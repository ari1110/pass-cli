# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced UI Controls and Usage Visibility

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All quality criteria met. The specification:
- Clearly defines three independent user stories with priority ordering (P1-P3)
- Contains 18 functional requirements that are testable and unambiguous
- Provides 8 technology-agnostic success criteria with measurable metrics
- Includes comprehensive acceptance scenarios for each user story
- Identifies 7 edge cases for consideration during implementation
- Documents assumptions and dependencies without prescribing implementation
- Makes zero references to specific programming languages, frameworks, or APIs
- Written entirely from user/business perspective

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

No issues identified. Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning phase.
