# Tasks: Security Hardening

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-security-hardening-address/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is a security-critical feature requiring verification of memory clearing, crypto timing, password validation, and audit integrity.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `internal/`, `cmd/`, `tests/` at repository root (R:\Test-Projects\pass-cli)
- All paths are absolute Windows paths

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Minimal project setup - project structure already exists

- [X] T001 Create new security package directory: `internal/security/`
- [X] T002 [P] Create test directory for security-specific tests: `tests/security/`
- [X] T003 [P] Verify Go 1.21+ installed and crypto/subtle available

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core password handling infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete. All stories depend on byte-based password handling.

- [X] T004 Expose clearBytes as public ClearBytes in `internal/crypto/crypto.go` (lines 150-159)
- [X] T005 Change readPassword return type from string to []byte in `cmd/helpers.go` (line 30: remove string() conversion)
- [X] T006 Update all readPassword call sites to accept []byte instead of string (7 call sites total: cmd/add.go lines 102, 151; cmd/init.go lines 58, 71; cmd/update.go line 137; cmd/tui.go line 165; plus cmd/helpers.go line 12 definition)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - byte-based password handling now available project-wide

---

- [X] T020g [US1] Add explicit memory zeroing to clipboard copy function in `cmd/get.go` and `cmd/tui/components/detail.go` immediately after password written to clipboard (FR-001, Constitution line 50)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - master password AND credential passwords are byte-based and cleared after use

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - CRITICAL for MVP
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion - CRITICAL for MVP (can run parallel to US1)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run parallel to US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Independent from US1/US2/US3
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Memory Security**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Crypto Hardening**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 (shares DeriveKey function) but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Password Policy**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1/US2 (validates before vault operations) but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3) - Audit Logging**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Instruments US1/US2/US3 operations but independently testable (optional feature)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach for security features)
- Models/structures before services
- Services before integration points
- Core implementation before CLI/TUI updates
- Story complete and verified before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T002, T003 can run in parallel
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T004, T005 can run in parallel (different files)
- **User Story 1 Tests**: T007, T008 can run in parallel (different test functions)
- **User Story 2 Entity Changes**: T024, T025 can run in parallel (different functions in same file, but conceptually separate)
- **User Story 2 Tests**: T021, T022, T023 can run in parallel (different test files)
- **User Story 3 Tests**: T037, T038, T039, T040 can run in parallel (different test files)
- **User Story 3 Structures**: T041, T042 can run in parallel (different declarations)
- **User Story 4 Tests**: T052, T053, T054, T055, T056 can run in parallel (different test files)
- **User Story 4 Structures**: T057, T058, T059 can run in parallel (different declarations)
- **Polish Phase**: T079, T080, T081, T083, T084, T085 can run in parallel (different commands/environments)
- **After Foundational completes**: All user stories (US1, US2, US3, US4) can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Memory Security)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T007: "Create memory inspection test in tests/security/memory_test.go"
Task T008: "Create panic recovery test in tests/security/memory_test.go"

# After tests are written and failing, these tasks can proceed sequentially
# (same file - internal/vault/vault.go):
Task T009: "Change VaultService.masterPassword field type"
Task T010: "Update Initialize signature"
Task T011: "Update Unlock signature"
# ... etc
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 4 (Audit Logging)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 4 together:
Task T052: "Create HMAC signature tests in internal/security/audit_test.go"
Task T053: "Create tamper detection tests in internal/security/audit_test.go"
Task T054: "Create log rotation tests in internal/security/audit_test.go"
Task T055: "Create privacy tests in internal/security/audit_test.go"
Task T056: "Create graceful degradation tests in internal/vault/vault_test.go"

# Launch all structures for User Story 4 together:
Task T057: "Create AuditLogEntry struct in internal/security/audit.go"
Task T058: "Create event type constants in internal/security/audit.go"
Task T059: "Create AuditLogger struct in internal/security/audit.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 + 3)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T006) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T007-T020g) - Memory Security (21 tasks including Credential.Password refactoring and clipboard zeroing)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T021-T036h) - Crypto Hardening (23 tasks including atomic migration with rollback safety)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T037-T051a) - Password Policy (16 tasks including rate limiting)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all three stories independently with memory inspection, crypto benchmarks, password validation, and migration safety
7. Run Phase 7 security scanning (T079-T081, T093-T094)
8. Deploy/demo if ready - **MVP complete with critical security fixes and password policy**

**MVP Rationale**: US1 + US2 + US3 address the most critical vulnerabilities and prevent weak password selection:
- US1 fixes master password AND credential password exposure in memory (High severity) - includes ~20 call site refactorings
- US2 fixes weak PBKDF2 iterations (Medium severity, OWASP compliance) - includes atomic migration with rollback per FR-011-015
- US3 prevents weak password selection (Medium severity) - no point in strong crypto if users choose "password123"
- Together they form a complete security foundation that addresses both system and user-caused vulnerabilities

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (21 tasks) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Memory security fixed for master + credentials)
3. Add User Story 2 (23 tasks) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Crypto hardening with safe migration)
4. Add User Story 3 (16 tasks) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Password policy enforced - **MVP!**)
5. Add User Story 4 (29 tasks) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Audit logging with keychain HMAC keys)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (must finish before stories start)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Memory Security)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Crypto Hardening)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Password Policy) - can start later
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Audit Logging) - can start later
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Merge order: US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 (by priority)

**Integration Points** (where stories touch):
- US1 + US2: Share crypto.DeriveKey function (both refactor signature)
- US3: Calls US1's byte-based vault operations for validation
- US4: Instruments US1/US2/US3 operations for logging

Despite integration points, each story is independently testable with mocked/stubbed dependencies.

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD approach for security**: All tests MUST fail before implementation (verify test catches the vulnerability)
- Commit after each task or logical group (per CLAUDE.md Section 2)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Critical vulnerability fix**: T009-T020 address the string-based password storage issue found in research.md
- **OWASP compliance**: T021-T036 bring PBKDF2 iterations to 2023 standard
- **Memory inspection**: Use delve debugger per quickstart.md:139-153
- **Cross-platform validation**: Constitution V requires Windows/macOS/Linux testing (T083-T085)
- **Security scanning**: Use gosec and golangci-lint before marking complete (T079-T080)
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts without ordering, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---
