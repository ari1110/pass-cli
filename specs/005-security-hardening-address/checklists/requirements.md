# Specification Quality Checklist: Security Hardening

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec is technology-agnostic, focuses on security requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Emphasizes protection against memory attacks, brute-force, weak passwords
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Uses plain language, explains WHY for each priority
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present and detailed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements are specific and concrete
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR has clear, measurable criteria (e.g., "600,000 iterations", "12+ characters")
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SC items include specific metrics (500-1000ms timing, 100% audit coverage, etc.)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - Written as user outcomes, not implementation ("memory inspection finds no password" vs "use []byte type")
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story has 4-5 Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 6 edge cases documented covering migration, GC, permissions, Unicode, corruption, rotation
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - 5 user stories with explicit priorities (2x P1 MVP, 1x P2, 2x P3)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - 8 documented assumptions, 4 dependencies listed, risks section covers UX/migration/platform concerns

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 35 FRs mapped to user stories and success criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - Covers memory security, crypto hardening, password policy, audit logging, rate limiting
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 8 success criteria directly map to FR requirements
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Spec maintains "WHAT/WHY" focus; "HOW" details in Notes only for testing strategy context

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items validated

**Review Notes**:
- Spec comprehensively addresses all 8 security issues from audit (1 MEDIUM, 3 LOW, 4 INFO)
- Priority ordering logical: P1 fixes critical vulnerabilities (memory/crypto), P2 prevents user error (password policy), P3 adds defense-in-depth (audit/rate-limit)
- Success criteria properly technology-agnostic (e.g., "memory inspection finds no password" rather than "use []byte")
- Backward compatibility strategy clearly documented to avoid breaking existing vaults
- All 5 user stories independently testable as required
- Edge cases thoughtfully cover GC timing, Unicode, migration, permissions, corruption scenarios
- Out of Scope section prevents feature creep (MFA, Argon2id, encrypted logs deferred)

**Readiness**: ✅ Ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
