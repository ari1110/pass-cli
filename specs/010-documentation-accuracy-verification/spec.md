# Feature Specification: Documentation Accuracy Verification and Remediation

**Feature Branch**: `010-documentation-accuracy-verification`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Documentation Accuracy Verification and Remediation - Conduct comprehensive audit of all repository documentation (README.md, USAGE.md, MIGRATION.md, SECURITY.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, INSTALLATION.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and all docs/ files) to verify factual accuracy against actual codebase implementation. Scope includes: (1) CLI interface verification - all documented commands, flags, aliases, and arguments match actual cmd/ implementation; (2) Code examples verification - all bash/PowerShell/Python/Makefile examples execute successfully and produce documented results; (3) File paths verification - all referenced paths exist at documented locations (config files, vault paths, example directories); (4) Configuration verification - YAML examples match actual config package structure, validation rules, and default values; (5) Feature claims verification - all documented features (audit logging, keychain integration, password policies, TUI shortcuts) exist and work as described; (6) Architecture descriptions verification - technical descriptions match actual internal/ package structure and implementation; (7) Metadata verification - version numbers, dates, status labels, and roadmap items are current; (8) Output examples verification - command output samples match actual CLI output format and content; (9) Cross-references verification - internal documentation links point to correct sections and files; (10) Behavioral descriptions verification - all "when X happens, Y occurs" claims are verifiable through testing. Root cause: Initial documentation (commit 1a60ce0) was written aspirationally from design specs rather than inspecting actual implementation, creating systematic inaccuracies that survived specs 008 (content quality review) and 009 (structural cleanup). Known issues include: add/update commands documenting non-existent --generate flags across README.md, USAGE.md, MIGRATION.md, SECURITY.md; missing --category flag documentation in USAGE.md. Goal: Ensure 100% documentation accuracy, restore user trust, prevent users from following broken examples, and establish verification process for future documentation changes."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - CLI Interface Verification (Priority: P1)

Repository maintainers need to verify that all documented commands, flags, aliases, and arguments in README.md, USAGE.md, and other documentation files match the actual implementation in cmd/ directory to prevent users from attempting non-existent commands.

**Why this priority**: This is the highest-impact issue. Users following documentation that references non-existent flags (e.g., `pass-cli add --generate`) will experience immediate failure and loss of trust. This directly affects user experience and credibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by comparing every documented command/flag against actual cmd/*.go files, running `pass-cli [command] --help` to capture actual CLI output, and identifying all discrepancies. Delivers value by ensuring users can successfully execute all documented commands.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** documentation references `pass-cli add --generate` flag, **When** maintainer checks cmd/add.go implementation, **Then** either flag exists in code OR documentation is flagged as incorrect
2. **Given** documentation lists command flags in a table, **When** maintainer runs `pass-cli [command] --help`, **Then** table matches actual help output exactly (flag names, types, descriptions)
3. **Given** USAGE.md documents command aliases (e.g., `generate`, `gen`, `pwd`), **When** maintainer checks cobra command definition, **Then** all aliases exist in cmd/*.go or discrepancies are flagged
4. **Given** documentation shows command arguments (e.g., `<service>`), **When** maintainer checks cobra Args validation, **Then** required/optional arguments match documentation

---

### User Story 2 - Code Examples Verification (Priority: P2)

Repository maintainers need to verify that all bash, PowerShell, Python, and Makefile code examples in documentation actually execute successfully and produce the documented results to prevent users from following broken tutorials.

**Why this priority**: Broken code examples are the second-highest priority because they lead to frustration and wasted time. Users copy-paste examples expecting them to work. Failed examples severely damage trust in the project.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by extracting all code blocks from documentation, executing each in an isolated environment, and comparing actual output to documented output. Delivers value by ensuring all tutorials and examples are functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** README.md shows bash example `export API_KEY=$(pass-cli get myservice --quiet)`, **When** maintainer executes command in test vault, **Then** command succeeds and API_KEY variable contains password
2. **Given** USAGE.md shows PowerShell example with Invoke-RestMethod, **When** maintainer runs example in PowerShell, **Then** script executes without errors
3. **Given** MIGRATION.md documents migration steps with command sequence, **When** maintainer follows steps on test vault, **Then** migration completes as documented
4. **Given** documentation shows output example (e.g., "âœ… Credential added successfully!"), **When** maintainer runs corresponding command, **Then** actual output matches documented format

---

### User Story 3 - Configuration and File Paths Verification (Priority: P3)

Repository maintainers need to verify that all referenced file paths (config locations, vault paths, example directories) exist at documented locations and that YAML configuration examples match actual config package structure to prevent configuration errors.

**Why this priority**: Configuration issues are critical for advanced users but don't affect basic usage. Incorrect config examples lead to validation errors and support burden. This is lower priority than commands/examples because it affects fewer users initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by checking existence of all referenced paths, parsing YAML examples against internal/config validation rules, and running `pass-cli config validate` on example configurations. Delivers value by ensuring configuration documentation is accurate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** USAGE.md documents config location `~/.config/pass-cli/config.yml`, **When** maintainer checks config.GetConfigPath() implementation, **Then** path matches documented location
2. **Given** README.md shows example config.yml with keybindings section, **When** maintainer validates YAML against internal/config package, **Then** all fields are valid and recognized
3. **Given** documentation references vault path `~/.pass-cli/vault.enc`, **When** maintainer checks default vault location in code, **Then** path matches documentation
4. **Given** USAGE.md shows terminal.min_width config value, **When** maintainer checks config validation rules, **Then** documented value is within accepted range

---

### User Story 4 - Feature Claims and Architecture Verification (Priority: P4)

Repository maintainers need to verify that all documented features (audit logging, keychain integration, password policies, TUI shortcuts) actually exist and work as described, and that architecture descriptions match actual internal/ package structure to maintain documentation credibility.

**Why this priority**: Feature accuracy is important for marketing and user expectations but doesn't cause immediate breakage like incorrect commands. Users discovering a documented feature doesn't exist is a credibility issue but not a usage blocker.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to use each documented feature, checking internal/ packages for described architecture, and verifying behavior matches documentation. Delivers value by ensuring feature set is accurately represented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** SECURITY.md documents audit logging with HMAC-SHA256 signatures, **When** maintainer enables audit logging and checks implementation, **Then** HMAC signatures are actually used as documented
2. **Given** README.md claims keychain integration with Windows Credential Manager, **When** maintainer checks internal/keychain implementation, **Then** Windows Credential Manager is actually used
3. **Given** USAGE.md documents password policy (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol), **When** maintainer checks internal/security package, **Then** policy enforcement matches documentation
4. **Given** README.md documents TUI keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+H` toggles password visibility), **When** maintainer tests TUI, **Then** shortcut behaves as documented

---

### User Story 5 - Metadata, Output Examples, and Cross-References Verification (Priority: P5)

Repository maintainers need to verify that version numbers, dates, status labels are current, that command output samples match actual CLI output format, and that internal documentation links point to correct sections to maintain documentation polish and usability.

**Why this priority**: These are quality-of-life improvements that don't prevent usage but improve documentation professionalism. Broken internal links and outdated metadata are lower priority than functional accuracy.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by checking version numbers against git tags, validating all markdown links resolve correctly, and comparing output samples to actual CLI output. Delivers value by ensuring documentation is polished and navigable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** README.md shows "Version: v0.0.1", **When** maintainer checks latest git tag, **Then** version number is current
2. **Given** USAGE.md shows output example with table format, **When** maintainer runs `pass-cli list`, **Then** actual output matches documented format (column headers, separators, alignment)
3. **Given** README.md links to `[docs/USAGE.md#configuration]`, **When** maintainer clicks link in rendered markdown, **Then** link resolves to correct section
4. **Given** documentation shows "Last Updated: January 2025", **When** maintainer checks document git history, **Then** last modification date matches or is more recent

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a documented command has evolved (e.g., flags added/removed in later versions)? Verification should capture current state and flag any version-specific discrepancies.
- How does verification handle platform-specific documentation (Windows vs. macOS vs. Linux paths)? All platform variants should be verified against their respective implementations.
- What happens when documentation uses placeholder examples (e.g., `myservice`, `github`) that don't exist in test vaults? Verification should distinguish between placeholder examples and actual command syntax errors.
- How does verification handle deprecated features that are still documented? System should flag deprecated features and recommend archival per documentation lifecycle policy.
- What happens when code examples require external dependencies (e.g., `mysql`, `curl`) that may not be installed? Verification should document dependencies and test only pass-cli-specific functionality.
