# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Accuracy Verification and Remediation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

**Validation Notes**:
- All mandatory sections complete (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- 5 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P5) and independent test descriptions
- 15 functional requirements, all testable
- 12 success criteria, all measurable and technology-agnostic
- 3 key entities defined with clear attributes
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Edge cases identified (5 scenarios)
- Scope clearly bounded to documentation verification only (not code changes)
- No implementation details (no mention of specific tools, frameworks, or languages beyond what's already in the repo)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan`
