Delete removes one or more credentials from your vault.

By default, you'll see a usage warning if the credential has been accessed before,
showing where and when it was last used. This helps prevent accidental deletion
of actively-used credentials.

You can delete multiple credentials at once by providing multiple service names.
Use --force to skip all confirmation prompts (dangerous!).

Usage:
  pass-cli delete <service> [service...] [flags]

Aliases:
  delete, rm, remove

Examples:
  # Delete a single credential
  pass-cli delete github

  # Delete multiple credentials
  pass-cli delete github gitlab bitbucket

  # Delete with alias
  pass-cli rm old-service

  # Force delete without confirmation (dangerous!)
  pass-cli delete github --force

Flags:
  -f, --force   skip confirmation prompts
  -h, --help    help for delete

Global Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.pass-cli/config.yaml)
      --vault string    vault file path (default is $HOME/.pass-cli/vault.enc)
  -v, --verbose         verbose output
