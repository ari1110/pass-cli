Initialize creates a new encrypted vault for storing credentials.

You will be prompted to create a master password that will be used to
encrypt and decrypt your vault. This password should be strong and memorable.

By default, your vault will be stored at ~/.pass-cli/vault.enc

Use the --use-keychain flag to store the master password in your system's
keychain (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service)
so you don't have to enter it every time.

Usage:
  pass-cli init [flags]

Examples:
  # Initialize a new vault
  pass-cli init

  # Initialize with keychain integration
  pass-cli init --use-keychain

  # Initialize with custom vault location
  pass-cli init --vault /path/to/vault.enc

Flags:
      --enable-audit   enable tamper-evident audit logging for vault operations
  -h, --help           help for init
      --use-keychain   store master password in system keychain

Global Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.pass-cli/config.yaml)
      --vault string    vault file path (default is $HOME/.pass-cli/vault.enc)
  -v, --verbose         verbose output
