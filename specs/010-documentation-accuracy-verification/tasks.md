# Tasks: Documentation Accuracy Verification and Remediation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-documentation-accuracy-verification/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, verification-procedures.md, audit-report.md

**Tests**: No test tasks - this feature IS the testing (documentation verification against implementation)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (verification category) to enable independent execution of each category.

**Phase Numbering Note**: This tasks.md uses execution-based phase numbers (Phase 1-8), while plan.md uses workflow-based phase names (Phase 0: Research, Phase 1: Audit Design). Both refer to the same work - plan.md describes the conceptual workflow, tasks.md provides the execution sequence.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Documentation files: `README.md`, `docs/USAGE.md`, `docs/MIGRATION.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, etc.
- Reference code: `cmd/*.go`, `internal/*/`
- Audit artifacts: `specs/010-documentation-accuracy-verification/audit-report.md`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: ‚úÖ Already complete (commit 50c6ab4)
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Setup + Foundational completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories (Phase 3-7) being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Setup - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Setup - No dependencies on other stories (some remediation overlaps with US1 but independently testable)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Setup - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Setup - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Setup - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Verification tasks (capture --help, extract examples, grep paths) can run in parallel where marked [P]
- Comparison/analysis tasks depend on verification completion
- Remediation tasks depend on discrepancy identification
- Commit tasks depend on all remediation for that story

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T004, T005 can run in parallel (different test credentials)
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: T011-T026 (all --help captures) can run in parallel, T037-T040 (file remediations) can run in parallel
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: T042-T045 (code block extraction) can run in parallel, T052-T053 (file remediations) can run in parallel
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: T057-T058 (grep operations) can run in parallel
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: T069-T075 (feature tests) can run in parallel
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: T084-T087 (verification checks) can run in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: T098-T106 (success criteria checks) can run in parallel
- **All user stories (Phase 3-7)** can run in parallel if team capacity allows

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all --help captures for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Execute pass-cli init --help, capture output"
Task: "Execute pass-cli add --help, capture output"
Task: "Execute pass-cli get --help, capture output"
... (14 commands total)

# Launch all remediation file edits together:
Task: "Remediate README.md:158,161 - remove --generate flag"
Task: "Remediate docs/USAGE.md:145-147 - remove --generate from table"
Task: "Remediate docs/USAGE.md:139-147 - add --category flag"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (test vault ready)
2. Phase 2: Foundational already complete ‚úÖ
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (CLI Interface Verification)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Verify SC-001 met (100% CLI accuracy)
5. Review audit-report.md CLI findings
6. If ready, proceed to next priority

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Environment ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí CLI verified ‚Üí Remediate (MVP - highest user impact!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Examples verified ‚Üí Remediate
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Config/paths verified ‚Üí Remediate
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Features verified ‚Üí Remediate
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Metadata/links verified ‚Üí Remediate
7. Each story independently improves documentation quality

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple maintainers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Setup is done:
   - Maintainer A: User Story 1 (CLI)
   - Maintainer B: User Story 2 (Examples)
   - Maintainer C: User Story 3 (Config/Paths)
   - Maintainer D: User Story 4 (Features)
   - Maintainer E: User Story 5 (Metadata)
3. Stories complete and remediate independently
4. Converge for Phase 8 (final validation)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files/commands, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific verification category for traceability
- Each user story represents a complete verification category that can be independently executed and remediated
- Known discrepancies (DISC-001 through DISC-005) are pre-identified from initial spot check
- Estimated 45-95 additional discrepancies to be discovered across all categories
- Commit after each user story remediation with DISC-### references in commit message
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate category independently
- Cleanup test environment only after all validation complete (Phase 8)
