# Specification Quality Checklist: User Configuration File

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Validation performed**: 2025-10-14 (retrospective validation after planning phase)
- **Initial validation result**: 4 issues found
- **Issues fixed**:
  1. Removed implementation details (tcellKey, tcell.EventKey) from Key Entities
  2. Rewrote Key Entities in plain business language (non-technical)
  3. Updated Success Criteria with measurable metrics (percentages, counts, timing)
  4. Clarified SC-010 wording (validation vs. config loading distinction)
- **Current status**: All checklist items now pass
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.tasks` phase
- Clarifications section documents Q&A session from 2025-10-14
- Three prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
