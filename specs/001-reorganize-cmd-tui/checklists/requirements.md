# Specification Quality Checklist: Reorganize cmd/tui Directory Structure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All quality criteria have been met:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on WHAT needs to happen (reorganization, verification) and WHY (preserve functionality, clean structure), not HOW to implement it.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010), all testable
   - 6 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006), all measurable
   - 4 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
   - Edge cases identified
   - Assumptions and dependencies documented
   - No clarification markers needed

3. **Feature Readiness**: Each requirement maps to user stories with clear acceptance criteria. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "TUI renders completely", "compiles successfully", "under 2 hours").

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- Developer workflow focus means "users" are the development team
- Manual verification required at each step (documented in requirements)
