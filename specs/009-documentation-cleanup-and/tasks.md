# Tasks: Documentation Cleanup and Archival

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/009-documentation-cleanup-and/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, policy-structure.md, audit-checklist.md

**Tests**: Not applicable - this is a documentation maintenance feature with no code implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Documentation files: `docs/`, `specs/`, repository root
- Policy document: `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md`
- Governance: `CONTRIBUTING.md`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Preparation)

**Purpose**: Capture baseline metrics and prepare tooling for documentation review

- [ ] T001 [US1+US2+US3] Capture baseline documentation metrics using specs/009-documentation-cleanup-and/audit-checklist.md Phase 1.1 commands:
  - Total doc file count: `find docs/ specs/ -name "*.md" | wc -l`
  - Sample time to update 3 random docs (for SC-001 baseline)
  - List all duplicate topic areas found via keyword searches (for SC-004 baseline)
  - Count search results for 5 common queries: installation, usage, configuration, troubleshooting, security (for SC-006 baseline)
- [ ] T002 [P] [US1+US2+US3] Verify ripgrep available for duplicate detection (`rg --version`)
- [ ] T003 [P] [US1+US2+US3] Verify git status clean and branch `009-documentation-cleanup-and` active

---

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - Documentation Lifecycle Policy (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Create and integrate documentation lifecycle policy to establish governance for all cleanup decisions

**Independent Test**: Verify `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` exists with 6 sections (Purpose, Classification, Retention, Triggers, Authority, Process) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` contains inline summary with link to full policy

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T004 [US1] Create `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` using template from specs/009-documentation-cleanup-and/policy-structure.md
- [ ] T005 [US1] Fill Section 1 (Purpose & Scope) in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` per policy-structure.md template
- [ ] T006 [P] [US1] Fill Section 2 (Document Classification) table in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` with 7 document types
- [ ] T007 [P] [US1] Fill Section 3 (Retention Rules) in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` including Rule 1 (indefinite spec retention per FR-008)
- [ ] T008 [P] [US1] Fill Section 4 (Archival Triggers) in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` with 4 trigger categories
- [ ] T009 [P] [US1] Fill Section 5 (Decision Authority) in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` with maintainer process
- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Fill Section 6 (Process Workflow) in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` with commit message templates
- [ ] T011 [US1] Update version and dates in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` (Version 1.0.0, Effective: 2025-01-15)
- [ ] T012 [US1] Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` to identify appropriate section for policy integration
- [ ] T013 [US1] Add "Documentation Governance" section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` with 2-3 sentence summary and link to `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` per clarification #2
- [ ] T014 [US1] Commit policy creation: `git commit -m "docs: create documentation lifecycle policy - establishes governance for doc management"`

**Checkpoint**: Policy document exists and is integrated into CONTRIBUTING.md - all cleanup decisions can now follow documented standards (FR-001, FR-002, FR-010, SC-003)

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Audit and Remove Obsolete Documentation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Identify and remove truly obsolete documentation following established policy

**Independent Test**: Verify docs/archive/ processed per policy, specs/ audited with retention decisions documented, all broken links fixed, duplicate content consolidated

### Implementation for User Story 2

**Sub-Phase 3a: docs/archive/ Directory Audit**

- [ ] T015 [US2] List all files in `docs/archive/` with last-modified dates per audit-checklist.md Phase 1.1
- [ ] T016 [US2] For EACH file in `docs/archive/`: evaluate against retention rules using audit-checklist.md Phase 1.2 template
- [ ] T017 [US2] Delete obsolete files from `docs/archive/` with rationale in commit messages per policy Section 6.1 format (FR-003, FR-007)
- [ ] T018 [US2] Document retention justification for any kept `docs/archive/` files in git commit message
- [ ] T019 [US2] Record docs/archive/ summary metrics in audit-checklist.md Phase 1.3 (files reviewed, kept, deleted, consolidated)

**Sub-Phase 3b: specs/ Directory Audit**

- [ ] T020 [US2] List all spec directories: `ls -d specs/*/` and categorize by feature status per audit-checklist.md Phase 2.2
- [ ] T021 [US2] For EACH spec directory: determine if feature is Active/Deprecated/Removed/Never Implemented/Created in Error
- [ ] T022 [US2] Process specs per retention policy Section 3 Rule 1 (default: keep indefinitely unless created in error) (FR-004, FR-008)
- [ ] T023 [US2] If any specs identified for deletion (created in error only): delete with detailed justification in commit message per policy Section 6.2 format
- [ ] T024 [US2] Record specs/ summary metrics in audit-checklist.md Phase 2.3 (total specs, active features, removed features, deleted)

**Sub-Phase 3c: Link Validation**

- [ ] T025 [US2] For each documentation file in `docs/` and repository root: manually verify all internal links using audit-checklist.md Phase 4.1 template
- [ ] T026 [US2] Fix broken internal links with correct paths in affected files (FR-006)
- [ ] T027 [US2] Update or remove broken external links (404s) in affected files
- [ ] T028 [US2] After deletions/consolidations: search for references to deleted files using `rg "<deleted-filename>" docs/ specs/ README.md CONTRIBUTING.md` per audit-checklist.md Phase 4.2
- [ ] T029 [US2] Update all references to deleted/consolidated files to point to canonical sources or remove if no replacement
- [ ] T030 [US2] Commit link fixes: `git commit -m "docs: fix broken links - updated N internal links, removed N dead external links"` per policy Section 6.3 format
- [ ] T031 [US2] Record link validation summary in audit-checklist.md Phase 4.3 (total broken links, links fixed, links removed)

**Checkpoint**: All obsolete documentation processed per policy, specs audited with retention decisions documented, zero broken links (FR-003, FR-004, FR-006, FR-007, SC-002, SC-005)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 3 - Consolidate Redundant Content (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Identify and merge overlapping documentation to create single sources of truth

**Independent Test**: Search for duplicate topics shows â‰¥50% reduction, consolidated content covers all use cases from original sources with no information loss

### Implementation for User Story 3

**Sub-Phase 4a: Duplicate Detection**

- [ ] T032 [P] [US3] Run keyword search for "installation" duplicates: `rg -i "installation" docs/ --files-with-matches` per audit-checklist.md Phase 3.1
- [ ] T033 [P] [US3] Run keyword search for "usage/getting started" duplicates: `rg -i "getting started|usage|quick start" docs/ --files-with-matches`
- [ ] T034 [P] [US3] Run keyword search for "configuration" duplicates: `rg -i "configuration|config|settings" docs/ --files-with-matches`
- [ ] T035 [P] [US3] Run keyword search for "troubleshooting" duplicates: `rg -i "troubleshoot|common issues|faq" docs/ --files-with-matches`
- [ ] T036 [P] [US3] Run keyword search for "security" duplicates: `rg -i "security|encryption|vault" docs/ --files-with-matches`
- [ ] T037 [US3] Analyze section header overlap: `rg "^##\s+" docs/ -N | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20` per audit-checklist.md Phase 3.2
- [ ] T038 [US3] Record all duplicate topic areas found in audit-checklist.md Phase 3.1 (before-consolidation baseline for SC-004)

**Sub-Phase 4b: Content Consolidation**

- [ ] T039 [US3] For EACH duplicate topic area identified: manually review all files using audit-checklist.md Phase 3.3 template
- [ ] T040 [US3] For EACH duplicate set: select canonical source (most comprehensive doc) per research.md Section 5 Pattern B guidance
- [ ] T041 [US3] For EACH duplicate set: extract unique content from duplicates and merge into canonical source (FR-005, FR-009)
- [ ] T042 [US3] For EACH duplicate set: verify consolidated content maintains coherent narrative structure and includes all unique information from sources
- [ ] T043 [US3] Delete duplicate files after consolidation: `git rm <duplicate-files>`
- [ ] T044 [US3] Commit each consolidation: `git commit -m "docs: consolidate <topic> into <canonical> - merged content from <file1>, <file2>"` per policy Section 6.2 format (FR-007)
- [ ] T045 [US3] Record consolidation summary in audit-checklist.md Phase 3.4 (topic areas searched, duplicate sets found, files consolidated, canonical sources)

**Checkpoint**: All duplicate content consolidated, single sources of truth established, no information loss verified (FR-005, FR-009, SC-004, SC-006)

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Final Validation

**Purpose**: Validate all success criteria and prepare for merge

- [ ] T046 [Polish] Verify SC-001: Calculate documentation maintenance effort reduction using formula `(baseline_file_count - final_file_count) / baseline_file_count >= 0.30` per audit-checklist.md Phase 6.1
- [ ] T047 [Polish] Verify SC-002: Confirm zero broken internal links (manual verification of all links tested) using audit-checklist.md Phase 6.1
- [ ] T048 [Polish] Verify SC-003: Confirm `docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md` exists with `CONTRIBUTING.md` integration using audit-checklist.md Phase 6.1
- [ ] T049 [Polish] Verify SC-004: Calculate duplicate reduction using formula `(baseline_duplicate_topic_areas - final_duplicate_topic_areas) / baseline_duplicate_topic_areas >= 0.50` per audit-checklist.md Phase 6.1
- [ ] T050 [Polish] Verify SC-005: Review all cleanup commits have documented rationale: `git log --grep="docs:" --oneline` using audit-checklist.md Phase 6.1
- [ ] T051 [Polish] Verify SC-006: Measure search clarity improvement using formula `(baseline_avg_search_results - final_avg_search_results) / baseline_avg_search_results >= 0.40` per audit-checklist.md Phase 6.1 (average across 5 common queries from T001)
- [ ] T052 [Polish] Verify SC-007: Confirm zero historical context loss (all deleted files accessible via git history, specs retained) using audit-checklist.md Phase 6.1
- [ ] T053 [Polish] Capture final metrics using audit-checklist.md Phase 6.2 (total doc file count, total line count, spec count)
- [ ] T054 [Polish] Complete audit completion summary in audit-checklist.md (date started/completed, total time, docs reviewed/deleted/consolidated, broken links fixed, commits created)
- [ ] T055 [Polish] Final git status check - ensure all changes committed and branch ready for merge using audit-checklist.md Phase 7.1

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **User Story 1 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS User Stories 2 & 3 (policy must exist before cleanup decisions)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on US1 completion (policy required for archival decisions)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US2 completion (consolidation happens after obsolete content removed to avoid redundant work)
- **Polish (Phase 5)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Must complete first - provides governance framework
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Requires US1 policy to guide archival decisions
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Requires US2 cleanup complete to avoid consolidating obsolete content

### Within Each User Story

**US1 (Policy Creation)**:
- T004 (create file) â†’ T005-T010 (fill sections in parallel) â†’ T011 (finalize) â†’ T012-T013 (CONTRIBUTING.md integration) â†’ T014 (commit)

**US2 (Obsolete Documentation Removal)**:
- Sub-phases can run sequentially: 3a (archive audit) â†’ 3b (spec audit) â†’ 3c (link validation)
- Within 3a: T015 â†’ T016-T018 (evaluate/delete files - sequential per file) â†’ T019 (summary)
- Within 3b: T020 â†’ T021-T022 (evaluate specs - sequential per spec) â†’ T023-T024 (delete/summary)
- Within 3c: T025-T027 (fix links per file) â†’ T028-T029 (update references) â†’ T030-T031 (commit/summary)

**US3 (Content Consolidation)**:
- Sub-phase 4a (detection): T032-T037 (all parallel keyword searches) â†’ T038 (summary)
- Sub-phase 4b (consolidation): T039-T042 (review/merge per duplicate set) â†’ T043-T045 (delete/commit/summary)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T002 and T003 can run in parallel
- **US1 Sections**: T006, T007, T008, T009, T010 (all policy sections) can be filled in parallel
- **US3 Detection**: T032-T036 (all keyword searches) can run in parallel

**Note**: Most tasks in this feature are sequential because they involve manual review and decision-making on the same set of documentation files. Parallel execution is limited to independent research/search tasks.

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Policy Sections

```bash
# Fill all policy sections in parallel (different sections of same file):
Task: "Fill Section 2 (Document Classification) table in docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md"
Task: "Fill Section 3 (Retention Rules) in docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md"
Task: "Fill Section 4 (Archival Triggers) in docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md"
Task: "Fill Section 5 (Decision Authority) in docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md"
Task: "Fill Section 6 (Process Workflow) in docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md"
```

**Note**: While these are marked [P] for parallel, in practice they may be done sequentially due to the narrative flow of the policy document.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (capture baselines)
2. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1 (create and integrate policy)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Verify policy document complete with all 6 sections and CONTRIBUTING.md integration
4. Policy can be used immediately for ongoing documentation decisions

**MVP Delivers**: Complete documentation lifecycle policy that guides all future documentation maintenance work (P1 goal achieved)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Setup â†’ US1**: Policy established â†’ Immediate value for ongoing doc decisions
2. **+US2**: Obsolete content removed â†’ Reduced maintenance burden + zero broken links
3. **+US3**: Duplicates consolidated â†’ Improved search clarity + single sources of truth
4. Each story adds value without breaking previous deliverables

### Sequential Execution (Recommended for Solo Maintainer)

1. Phase 1 (Setup): 3 tasks - ~30 minutes
2. Phase 2 (US1 Policy): 11 tasks - ~8-12 hours (policy drafting and review)
3. Phase 3 (US2 Cleanup): 17 tasks - ~20-40 hours (file-by-file review)
4. Phase 4 (US3 Consolidation): 14 tasks - ~15-25 hours (content merging and validation)
5. Phase 5 (Polish): 10 tasks - ~4-6 hours (metrics and validation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 50-85 hours

---

## Notes

- **No code changes**: All tasks involve documentation file editing and git operations
- **Manual review required**: Most tasks require human judgment per policy guidelines
- **Atomic commits**: Each deletion/consolidation gets its own commit with rationale per FR-007
- **Zero information loss**: US3 consolidation tasks MUST verify all unique content preserved per FR-009
- **Policy first**: US1 MUST complete before US2/US3 to ensure consistent cleanup decisions
- **Git history as archive**: Deleted files remain accessible via `git log --follow` and `git show <commit>:<path>` per research.md Section 3
- **Success criteria tracking**: audit-checklist.md provides templates for all SC-001 through SC-007 validation
- **Empty-set handling**: For tasks stating "For EACH file/spec/duplicate set", if zero items are found matching criteria, document the finding (e.g., "Zero obsolete files in docs/archive/") and proceed to next task. This is a valid outcome, not a failure.

**Commit discipline**: Follow constitution Development Workflow: commit frequently after each task or logical group with detailed rationale in commit messages.
