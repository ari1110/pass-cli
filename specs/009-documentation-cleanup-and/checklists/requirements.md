# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Cleanup and Archival

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**:

**ALL CHECKS PASSING (14/14 items)** ✓

- Content is technology-agnostic and user-focused
- All mandatory sections complete (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- Requirements are testable (each FR can be verified)
- Success criteria are measurable (30% reduction, 50% reduction, zero broken links, 40% improvement)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format correctly
- Edge cases comprehensively identified (5 scenarios covering git history, partial obsolescence, historical value, format diversity, ongoing maintenance)
- Scope clearly bounded to documentation cleanup with specific focus areas
- Feature readiness confirmed - no implementation leakage
- All clarifications resolved (Q1: delete permanently via git history, Q2: indefinite retention for specs)

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. **Archival Approach**: Obsolete documentation will be deleted permanently; git history preserves content if recovery needed
2. **Retention Period**: All spec artifacts retained indefinitely to preserve complete design history (markdown files have minimal storage impact)

**Status**: ✅ Ready for `/speckit.plan`
