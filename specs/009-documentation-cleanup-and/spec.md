# Feature Specification: Documentation Cleanup and Archival

**Feature Branch**: `009-documentation-cleanup-and`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Documentation Cleanup and Archival - Remove obsolete documentation, archive outdated files, eliminate redundant content, and establish documentation lifecycle policy. Focus areas: review docs/archive/ directory for truly obsolete content, identify duplicate/redundant documentation across the repo, remove old spec artifacts that are no longer needed, consolidate overlapping content, and create a clear policy for when/how to archive documentation going forward. Goal is to reduce documentation maintenance burden while preserving historical context where valuable."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- Q: Where should the cleanup decision log be maintained? → A: Commit messages only (rationale in each git commit)
- Q: How should the documentation lifecycle policy be integrated into CONTRIBUTING.md? → A: Inline summary (2-3 sentence summary in CONTRIBUTING.md + link to full policy document)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Documentation Lifecycle Policy (Priority: P1)

Repository maintainers need a clear, documented policy for managing documentation lifecycle to ensure consistent decisions about what to keep, archive, or remove. This policy will guide all future documentation maintenance work and prevent accumulation of obsolete content.

**Why this priority**: Establishing the policy first prevents rework and ensures all cleanup decisions align with documented standards. Without this, cleanup work may need to be redone if policy changes.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the policy document exists at docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md, covers all decision criteria (retention periods, archival triggers, approval process), and has inline summary with link in CONTRIBUTING.md. Delivers value by providing clear guidance to all contributors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no documentation lifecycle policy exists, **When** maintainer creates policy document, **Then** policy includes retention periods for different doc types (specs, guides, examples), archival triggers (version obsolescence, feature removal), and approval process
2. **Given** policy document exists, **When** contributor needs to archive old documentation, **Then** policy clearly states whether to delete or move to archive, and what metadata to preserve
3. **Given** new spec is merged, **When** maintainer reviews old spec artifacts, **Then** policy provides decision tree for keeping vs. archiving based on feature status and historical value

### User Story 2 - Audit and Remove Obsolete Documentation (Priority: P2)

Repository maintainers need to identify and remove truly obsolete documentation that no longer provides value, while preserving historical context where useful. This reduces maintenance burden by eliminating outdated information that could confuse contributors.

**Why this priority**: Core cleanup work that directly achieves the goal of reducing documentation maintenance burden. Must follow P1 policy to avoid rework.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running link checkers, searching for version references, and verifying all flagged obsolete docs have been processed according to policy. Delivers value by reducing documentation surface area and preventing outdated information from misleading users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** docs/archive/ directory exists, **When** maintainer reviews each file, **Then** files meeting obsolete criteria per policy are deleted permanently (git history preserves content if recovery needed) and remaining files have clear retention justification documented
2. **Given** old spec directories in specs/ folder, **When** maintainer audits spec artifacts, **Then** specs for removed/superseded features are processed per policy and active specs remain untouched
3. **Given** repository documentation, **When** automated scan runs, **Then** no broken links exist and all external references point to current versions
4. **Given** duplicate documentation identified, **When** maintainer consolidates content, **Then** single canonical source exists with redirects or removal of duplicates

---

### User Story 3 - Consolidate Redundant Content (Priority: P3)

Repository maintainers need to identify and merge overlapping documentation to create single sources of truth, improving documentation quality and reducing inconsistencies. This enhances user experience by eliminating confusion from conflicting information.

**Why this priority**: Quality improvement that builds on P2 cleanup work. Can be deferred if time-constrained since it's about optimization rather than removal of obsolete content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by searching for duplicate topics across documentation, verifying consolidated content covers all use cases from original sources, and confirming no information loss. Delivers value by improving documentation clarity and consistency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple docs covering same topic (e.g., installation instructions in README, INSTALLATION.md, and quick-start guide), **When** maintainer consolidates, **Then** single canonical document exists with cross-references from other locations
2. **Given** overlapping content identified, **When** maintainer merges content, **Then** combined document includes all unique information from sources and maintains coherent narrative structure
3. **Given** consolidated documentation, **When** contributor searches for information, **Then** search results point to single authoritative source rather than multiple partial sources

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when archived documentation is referenced in git history or old issues? Policy should specify whether to maintain redirects or update references.
- How does system handle documentation that is partially obsolete but partially still relevant? Policy should define criteria for updating vs. archiving vs. splitting.
- What happens when spec artifacts have historical value for understanding design decisions? Policy should specify retention criteria based on feature status (active, deprecated, removed).
- How does cleanup process handle documentation in multiple formats (markdown, HTML, PDF)? Policy should specify format-specific retention rules.
- What happens when contributors discover obsolete content after initial cleanup? Policy should define ongoing maintenance workflow.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Repository MUST have documented policy for documentation lifecycle management including retention periods, archival triggers, approval process, and decision criteria
- **FR-002**: Policy MUST distinguish between different documentation types (specs, user guides, API docs, examples, architecture docs) with type-specific retention rules
- **FR-003**: Maintainers MUST audit docs/archive/ directory and process all files according to established policy, documenting decisions for any retained files
- **FR-004**: Maintainers MUST audit specs/ directory for old spec artifacts and process according to policy, preserving specs for active features and handling deprecated/removed feature specs per retention rules
- **FR-005**: Cleanup process MUST identify and eliminate duplicate/redundant documentation while preserving unique information and historical context
- **FR-006**: Cleanup process MUST validate all internal links and fix broken references before completion
- **FR-007**: Cleanup process MUST document all removal decisions with rationale in git commit messages (accessible via git log and git history)
- **FR-008**: Policy MUST specify indefinite retention for all spec artifacts to preserve complete design history (markdown files have minimal storage impact)
- **FR-009**: Consolidated documentation MUST maintain or improve information completeness compared to original sources (no information loss)
- **FR-010**: Policy document MUST be integrated into repository governance via inline summary in CONTRIBUTING.md (2-3 sentence overview + link to full policy at docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md)

### Key Entities

- **Documentation Lifecycle Policy**: Defines retention periods, archival triggers (feature removal, version obsolescence, content superseded), approval workflows, and format-specific rules. Serves as decision-making framework for all cleanup activities.
- **Documentation Inventory**: Catalog of all documentation files with metadata including type, creation date, last update, referenced features/versions, and retention status. Implemented via `specs/009-documentation-cleanup-and/audit-checklist.md` template which tracks cleanup progress and justifies retention decisions.
- **Cleanup Decision Log**: Record of all archival/removal decisions maintained in git commit messages with rationale, date, and affected files. Provides audit trail via git history for future maintenance.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Documentation maintenance effort reduces by at least 30% (measured by time to update docs for new releases or answer "where is X documented" questions)
- **SC-002**: Repository has zero broken internal documentation links after cleanup completion
- **SC-003**: Documentation lifecycle policy document exists at docs/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE.md with inline summary and link in CONTRIBUTING.md
- **SC-004**: At least 50% reduction in duplicate/overlapping documentation identified during audit (measured by topic areas covered by multiple documents)
- **SC-005**: 100% of archived/removed documentation has documented rationale in git commit messages
- **SC-006**: Documentation search clarity improves by 40% (measured by reduction in multiple search results for same topic)
- **SC-007**: Zero historical context loss - all design decisions and rationale from archived specs remain accessible per policy retention rules
