# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Review and Production Release Preparation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on documentation accuracy, completeness, and user outcomes
- No implementation details mentioned (focuses on what documentation should contain, not how to update it)
- Written for stakeholders evaluating documentation readiness for production release
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements use reasonable defaults based on existing documentation structure
- Requirements testable (e.g., "100% of documented CLI commands execute successfully")
- Success criteria measurable (e.g., "10 minutes", "5 minutes", "100%", "Zero references")
- Success criteria technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes: time to complete tasks, findability, accuracy)
- 5 user stories with acceptance scenarios covering P1-P3 priorities
- Edge cases identified for version mismatches, package manager lag, external link stability
- Scope clearly bounded: review/update existing docs, exclude new files/translations/tutorials
- Dependencies (specs 001-007 merged) and assumptions (release tagged, package managers updated) identified

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- 15 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-015) map to acceptance scenarios
- User scenarios cover primary flows: new user onboarding (P1), security evaluation (P1), automation (P2), version accuracy (P2), troubleshooting (P3)
- Measurable outcomes defined: 10 min Quick Start, 5 min troubleshooting, 100% command accuracy, zero outdated references
- No implementation details leak (doesn't specify tools, editors, or processes for updating docs)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

This specification is complete and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase. All quality criteria met:
- User scenarios prioritized and independently testable
- Requirements specific and verifiable
- Success criteria measurable and user-focused
- Scope appropriately bounded
- No clarifications needed - existing documentation structure provides sufficient context
