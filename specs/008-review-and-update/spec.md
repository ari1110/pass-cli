# Feature Specification: Documentation Review and Production Release Preparation

**Feature Branch**: `008-review-and-update`
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "review and update our documentation for production release"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - New User Onboarding Success (Priority: P1)

A developer discovers Pass-CLI on GitHub and wants to evaluate whether it meets their password management needs. They need clear, accurate documentation to install, understand security guarantees, and start using the tool within 15 minutes.

**Why this priority**: First impressions determine adoption. Incomplete or outdated documentation causes immediate abandonment and negative reviews.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by giving documentation to a developer unfamiliar with Pass-CLI and measuring time-to-first-credential and comprehension of security model.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user reads the README, **When** they follow Quick Start instructions, **Then** they successfully install Pass-CLI, initialize a vault, and add their first credential within 10 minutes
2. **Given** a user reads the SECURITY.md file, **When** they assess whether Pass-CLI meets their security requirements, **Then** they can identify encryption algorithm, key derivation parameters, threat model, and limitations without external research
3. **Given** a developer reads installation docs, **When** they choose their installation method (Homebrew/Scoop/manual), **Then** all commands execute successfully with current release version

---

### User Story 2 - Production Deployment Confidence (Priority: P1)

An organization's security team evaluates Pass-CLI for company-wide deployment. They require complete, accurate documentation of security architecture, compliance standards, audit capabilities, and incident response procedures.

**Why this priority**: Enterprise adoption requires comprehensive security documentation. Missing or unclear security details block production deployments.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by security professionals reviewing documentation against OWASP/NIST checklists and confirming all security questions are answered.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a security auditor reviews SECURITY.md, **When** they validate cryptographic implementation, **Then** they find complete specifications for AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2 parameters (600k iterations), salt/nonce generation, and NIST compliance references
2. **Given** a compliance officer reviews audit logging documentation, **When** they assess tamper-evidence capabilities, **Then** they understand HMAC-SHA256 signatures, key storage, log rotation, and verification procedures
3. **Given** an incident response team reviews security docs, **When** they plan for master password compromise, **Then** they find actionable response procedures for all security incident types

---

### User Story 3 - CLI vs TUI Mode Clarity (Priority: P2)

A script author needs to integrate Pass-CLI into CI/CD pipelines and needs to understand when the tool launches TUI mode versus CLI mode, and how to reliably use CLI commands in automated environments.

**Why this priority**: Mode confusion causes automation failures. Users must understand `pass-cli` (no args, TUI) versus `pass-cli list` (explicit command, CLI).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by writing shell scripts that use Pass-CLI and confirming documentation accurately describes behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user reads USAGE.md, **When** they learn about TUI vs CLI modes, **Then** they understand `pass-cli` launches TUI while `pass-cli <command>` uses CLI mode
2. **Given** a developer writes automation scripts, **When** they reference script integration examples, **Then** all examples use explicit commands (`pass-cli get`, `pass-cli list`) and avoid accidental TUI launches
3. **Given** a user encounters unexpected TUI launch, **When** they consult troubleshooting docs, **Then** they find explanation that no arguments triggers TUI mode

---

### User Story 4 - Version-Specific Accuracy (Priority: P2)

A user on an older version of Pass-CLI reads documentation and encounters feature references or examples that don't work with their installed version, causing confusion and support burden.

**Why this priority**: Documentation-code mismatch erodes trust and increases support costs. All documented features must match current release.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by installing current release version and verifying every documented command, flag, and feature works exactly as described.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** documentation references password policy, **When** user reads enforcement details, **Then** iteration count (600k), policy requirements (12+ chars, complexity), and migration path match current implementation
2. **Given** documentation shows CLI examples, **When** user executes commands from docs, **Then** all flags, arguments, and output formats work without errors
3. **Given** documentation references TUI keyboard shortcuts, **When** user presses documented keys, **Then** all shortcuts (`Ctrl+H`, `/`, `s`, `i`, etc.) perform described actions

---

### User Story 5 - Troubleshooting Self-Service (Priority: P3)

A user encounters an issue (keychain access denied, vault corruption, terminal rendering) and wants to resolve it without filing a GitHub issue or waiting for support response.

**Why this priority**: Comprehensive troubleshooting reduces support burden and improves user satisfaction during problem scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating common error scenarios and confirming TROUBLESHOOTING.md provides actionable solutions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user encounters "Failed to Retrieve Master Password" error, **When** they search TROUBLESHOOTING.md, **Then** they find platform-specific solutions (macOS keychain unlock, Linux secret service, Windows Credential Manager)
2. **Given** a user experiences TUI rendering artifacts, **When** they consult troubleshooting guide, **Then** they find solutions for TERM variable, terminal emulator choice, and font requirements
3. **Given** a user's vault file becomes corrupted, **When** they follow recovery procedures, **Then** they successfully restore from automatic backup or manual backup files

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when documentation references features removed or renamed in current version?
- How does system handle users on older Pass-CLI versions reading latest documentation?
- What occurs when installation instructions reference package manager versions (Homebrew/Scoop) that haven't updated to latest release yet?
- How are breaking changes between versions communicated in documentation?
- What happens when external links (GitHub, NIST specs) become unavailable or move?
- What happens if documented TUI keyboard shortcuts changed between spec 007 and current implementation (e.g., toggle detail 'i' vs 'Tab')?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
