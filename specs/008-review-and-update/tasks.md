# Tasks: Documentation Review and Production Release Preparation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-review-and-update/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/documentation-validation-schema.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No automated test generation for documentation review. Validation is manual + scripted checks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (5 user stories, P1-P3 priorities) to enable independent validation and review of each documentation concern.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Documentation files**: `R:\Test-Projects\pass-cli\docs\`, `R:\Test-Projects\pass-cli\README.md`
- **Validation scripts**: `R:\Test-Projects\pass-cli\specs\008-review-and-update\validation\`
- **Spec artifacts**: `R:\Test-Projects\pass-cli\specs\008-review-and-update\`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Validation Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create validation scripts and tracking infrastructure for documentation review

- [X] **T001** [P] Create validation scripts directory at `specs/008-review-and-update/validation/`
- [X] **T002** [P] Create validation tracking spreadsheet or JSON file at `specs/008-review-and-update/validation/tracking.json` (based on data-model.md structure)
- [ ] **T003** [P] Install validation tools: `npm install -g markdown-link-check` (optional but recommended)

**Checkpoint**: Validation infrastructure ready

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Automated Validation Scripts)

**Purpose**: Core validation scripts that ALL user stories depend on for accuracy verification

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: These scripts must be complete and working before ANY documentation file review can begin

- [X] **T004** Create `specs/008-review-and-update/validation/version-audit.sh` script
  - Grep all docs for version references
  - Flag inconsistencies (multiple versions)
  - Flag outdated iteration counts (100,000 vs 600,000)
  - Output: List of files with version issues
  - Exit code 0 if clean, 1 if issues found

- [X] **T005** [P] Create `specs/008-review-and-update/validation/command-tests.sh` script
  - Extract all `pass-cli <command>` examples from docs
  - Execute `<command> --help` to verify command exists
  - Log failures with file and line number
  - Output: List of invalid commands
  - Exit code 0 if all valid, 1 if failures

- [X] **T006** [P] Create `specs/008-review-and-update/validation/link-check.sh` script
  - Use markdown-link-check or curl to validate HTTP/HTTPS links
  - Validate internal file links resolve
  - Handle 404 errors gracefully: suggest archive.org fallback URLs (edge case E1 fix)
  - Output: List of broken links with URLs and suggested fallbacks
  - Exit code 0 if all links valid, 1 if broken links

- [X] **T007** [P] Create `specs/008-review-and-update/validation/cross-reference-check.sh` script
  - Parse cross-references between files (e.g., "See MIGRATION.md")
  - Verify referenced content exists in target file
  - Output: List of broken cross-references
  - Exit code 0 if all valid, 1 if broken refs

- [X] **T008** Create `specs/008-review-and-update/validation/run-all-validation.sh` wrapper script
  - Execute all 4 validation scripts in parallel
  - Collect exit codes
  - Generate summary report
  - Exit code 0 only if all scripts pass

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - documentation file reviews can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (README): Independent - can start after Foundational
  - User Story 2 (SECURITY): Independent - can start after Foundational
  - User Story 3 (USAGE): Independent - can start after Foundational
  - User Story 4 (INSTALLATION, MIGRATION): Independent - can start after Foundational
  - User Story 5 (TROUBLESHOOTING, KNOWN_LIMITATIONS): Independent - can start after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - README)**: Can start after Foundational (T004-T008) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1 - SECURITY)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2 - USAGE)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2 - INSTALLATION, MIGRATION)**: Can start after Foundational - References SECURITY (T018 ‚Üî T030 cross-ref)
- **User Story 5 (P3 - TROUBLESHOOTING, KNOWN_LIMITATIONS)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Documentation file review tasks are sequential (same file edits)
- Validation tasks run after review tasks complete
- Cross-reference verification after both files updated (T031 depends on T020 for SECURITY ‚Üî MIGRATION)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: All T001-T003 marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: T005, T006, T007 marked [P] can run in parallel (T004 sequential - creates base script)
- **User Stories**: Once Foundational complete (T008 done), ALL user stories (US1-US5) can be worked on in parallel by different reviewers
- **Polish Phase**: T036, T037, T038 marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: After Foundational Phase

```bash
# Once T008 completes, launch all user story reviews in parallel:

# Reviewer 1:
Task: "Review README.md - Version accuracy" (T009)
Task: "Review README.md - Quick Start" (T010)
Task: "Review README.md - TUI shortcuts" (T011)
...

# Reviewer 2:
Task: "Review SECURITY.md - Crypto specs" (T015)
Task: "Review SECURITY.md - Password policy" (T016)
Task: "Review SECURITY.md - Audit logging" (T017)
...

# Reviewer 3:
Task: "Review USAGE.md - TUI vs CLI" (T021)
Task: "Review USAGE.md - Keyboard shortcuts" (T022)
Task: "Review USAGE.md - CLI commands" (T023)
...

# Reviewer 4:
Task: "Review INSTALLATION.md - Homebrew" (T026)
Task: "Review INSTALLATION.md - Scoop" (T027)
Task: "Review MIGRATION.md - Iteration upgrade" (T030)
...

# Reviewer 5:
Task: "Review TROUBLESHOOTING.md - TUI issues" (T032)
Task: "Review KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md - Accuracy" (T034)
...
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + 2 Only - Both P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T008) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - README.md (T009-T014)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - SECURITY.md (T015-T020)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test README Quick Start (‚â§10 min), verify SECURITY.md completeness
6. These two files are highest priority (both P1) - ready for production if validated

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Validation infrastructure ready
2. Add User Story 1 (README) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Commit
3. Add User Story 2 (SECURITY) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Commit (MVP! - Both P1 complete)
4. Add User Story 3 (USAGE) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Commit (P2)
5. Add User Story 4 (INSTALLATION, MIGRATION) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Commit (P2)
6. Add User Story 5 (TROUBLESHOOTING, KNOWN_LIMITATIONS) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Commit (P3)
7. Polish & Cross-Cutting ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple reviewers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T008)
2. Once T008 completes:
   - Reviewer A: User Story 1 (README) - T009-T014
   - Reviewer B: User Story 2 (SECURITY) - T015-T020
   - Reviewer C: User Story 3 (USAGE) - T021-T025
   - Reviewer D: User Story 4 (INSTALLATION, MIGRATION) - T026-T031
   - Reviewer E: User Story 5 (TROUBLESHOOTING, KNOWN_LIMITATIONS) - T032-T035
3. Stories complete independently, merge sequentially or in parallel
4. Team reconvenes for Polish phase (T036-T040)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label (US1-US5) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story validates different documentation files independently
- Foundational validation scripts (T004-T008) are CRITICAL - block all file reviews
- Commit after each user story phase completes (5 commits + 1 polish commit = 6 total)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: same-file conflicts (sequential tasks within story), cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 3 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 5 tasks (CRITICAL - blocks all user stories)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - README)**: 6 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US2 - SECURITY)**: 6 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - USAGE)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - INSTALLATION, MIGRATION)**: 6 tasks
- **Phase 7 (US5 - TROUBLESHOOTING, KNOWN_LIMITATIONS)**: 4 tasks
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 5 tasks

**Total**: 40 tasks across 8 phases (5 user story phases + 3 infrastructure phases)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Setup phase: 3 tasks can run in parallel
- Foundational phase: 3 tasks can run in parallel (T005-T007)
- User story phases: All 5 user stories can be worked on in parallel after Foundational completes
- Polish phase: 3 tasks can run in parallel (T036-T038)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: README Quick Start walkthrough ‚â§10 minutes
- US2: Security professional confirms crypto params complete
- US3: Script author successfully writes automation avoiding TUI launches
- US4: Fresh install succeeds on 3 platforms
- US5: Common issues findable in ‚â§5 minutes

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 + User Story 2 (README + SECURITY - both P1, highest priority for production release)
