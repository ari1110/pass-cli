# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Update for Recent Application Changes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Initial Validation (2025-10-11)

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items satisfied

**Review Notes**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on documentation outcomes (accuracy, completeness, discoverability) rather than technical implementation details. Written to be understood by project maintainers and contributors.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 10 functional requirements are testable (can verify by checking docs against code)
   - Success criteria include measurable metrics (2 minutes, 30 minutes, 100%, zero broken references)
   - No clarification markers needed - scope is clear (update docs for specs 001-003)
   - Edge cases cover common documentation pitfalls

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - User scenarios prioritized by impact (P1: architecture, P2: features, P3: workflow)
   - Each scenario independently testable
   - Success criteria verify documentation completeness and accuracy
   - Assumptions clearly state what hasn't changed (CLI functionality)

**Conclusion**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

## Notes

- Feature scope limited to documentation updates for recent changes (specs 001-003 and TUI reorganization)
- Does not include creating new features or changing application behavior
- Assumes existing CLI documentation remains accurate; focuses on TUI and development workflow
- Success depends on thorough audit of existing docs against current codebase
