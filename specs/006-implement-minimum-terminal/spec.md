# Feature Specification: Minimum Terminal Size Enforcement

**Feature Branch**: `006-implement-minimum-terminal`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement minimum terminal size enforcement with a blocking warning overlay that displays when the terminal is resized below usable dimensions"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: How should the system respond when a user rapidly resizes the terminal back and forth across the minimum threshold multiple times per second? → A: Show/hide warning immediately on every resize event without debouncing (visual flashing is acceptable as long as application functionality is not affected)
- Q: When a user has a modal/dialog open and resizes below minimum, what should happen? → A: Size warning takes precedence - keep modal state but overlay warning on top (as long as this doesn't affect actual app functionality)
- Q: When terminal dimensions are exactly at the minimum (60×30), should the warning display? → A: Minimum dimensions adjusted to 60 columns × 30 rows (increased from 60×20 for better usability). At exactly 60×30, warning should NOT display (inclusive boundary).
- Q: Should the warning trigger if only ONE dimension fails (e.g., width OK but height too small)? → A: Show warning if EITHER dimension fails (width < 60 OR height < 30)
- Q: When the app starts in an already-too-small terminal, should behavior differ from runtime resizing? → A: Same behavior - show warning immediately on startup

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Terminal Size Warning Display (Priority: P1)

A user launches the application in a terminal window that is too small to display the interface properly. The application immediately shows a clear warning message explaining the problem and the minimum required dimensions.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that prevents user confusion and interface corruption. Without this, users may see garbled or unusable UI without understanding why.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the app in a small terminal (e.g., 50×20) and verifying that a warning appears instead of the normal interface, and that the warning clearly states current and required dimensions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is not running, **When** a user launches it in a terminal smaller than minimum dimensions, **Then** a blocking warning overlay appears showing current dimensions and minimum required dimensions
2. **Given** the application is running normally, **When** the user resizes the terminal below minimum dimensions, **Then** the warning overlay immediately appears and blocks interaction with the main interface
3. **Given** the warning overlay is displayed, **When** the overlay is shown, **Then** it clearly displays both the current terminal dimensions and the minimum required dimensions

---

### User Story 2 - Automatic Recovery (Priority: P2)

A user who has triggered the size warning resizes their terminal window to meet or exceed the minimum dimensions. The application automatically detects the size change, removes the warning, and restores normal functionality.

**Why this priority**: This provides a smooth user experience by automatically recovering without requiring application restart. It's secondary to showing the warning but essential for usability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by first triggering the warning (small terminal), then resizing to adequate dimensions, and verifying the warning disappears and the interface becomes functional again.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the warning overlay is currently displayed, **When** the user resizes the terminal to meet minimum dimensions, **Then** the warning automatically disappears and the main interface becomes interactive
2. **Given** the warning overlay is currently displayed, **When** the user resizes the terminal to exceed minimum dimensions, **Then** the warning automatically disappears and the main interface displays correctly at the new size
3. **Given** normal operation after recovery, **When** the interface is displayed, **Then** all UI components are properly sized and functional for the current terminal dimensions

---

### User Story 3 - Visual Clarity and Feedback (Priority: P3)

A user experiencing the size warning needs to understand the issue at a glance and know exactly what action to take. The warning message is visually distinct from the normal interface and provides clear, actionable information.

**Why this priority**: This improves user experience by making the warning obvious and informative, but the feature is functional even with a basic warning message.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering the warning and evaluating whether a non-technical user can understand the problem and solution without external help.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the warning is displayed, **When** viewed by the user, **Then** the warning uses a distinct visual style (e.g., different background color) that makes it immediately obvious this is an error state
2. **Given** the warning is displayed, **When** the user reads the message, **Then** the warning explains the problem in plain language (e.g., "Terminal too small") without technical jargon
3. **Given** the warning is displayed, **When** the user reads the message, **Then** the warning provides clear instructions on how to resolve the issue (e.g., "Please resize your terminal window")

### Edge Cases

- **Rapid oscillation**: When terminal is resized rapidly between valid and invalid sizes, warning shows/hides immediately on every event. Visual flashing is acceptable as long as core application functionality remains unaffected.
- **Boundary condition**: Terminal dimensions at exactly 60×30 (the minimum) are considered acceptable. Warning displays only when width < 60 OR height < 30 (exclusive boundary).
- **Modal interaction**: When terminal is resized below minimum while a modal/dialog is open, the warning overlay takes precedence and displays on top while preserving modal state. Application functionality must not be affected.
- **Partial dimension failure**: Warning triggers if EITHER width < 60 OR height < 30. Both dimensions must meet minimum for warning to be hidden (e.g., 70×25 triggers warning due to insufficient height).
- **Startup size check**: If terminal is already below minimum size at application startup, warning displays immediately using the same behavior as runtime resize events. No special startup handling required.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST define minimum terminal dimensions (width and height) below which the interface cannot function properly
- **FR-002**: System MUST continuously monitor terminal dimensions during application runtime
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a blocking warning overlay when terminal dimensions fall below the minimum threshold (warning triggers if width < 60 OR height < 30)
- **FR-004**: System MUST show both current dimensions and required minimum dimensions in the warning message
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically hide the warning overlay when terminal dimensions meet or exceed minimum requirements
- **FR-006**: System MUST block user interaction with the main interface while the warning is displayed
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow the main interface to resume normal operation immediately after the warning is dismissed
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle rapid resize events without performance degradation (visual flickering of warning overlay is acceptable during rapid oscillation as long as application functionality is not affected)
- **FR-009**: System MUST check terminal dimensions at application startup and display warning immediately if already too small (same behavior as runtime resize)
- **FR-010**: Warning overlay MUST remain visible and readable even when terminal is extremely small

### Assumptions

- Minimum dimensions are 60 columns width and 30 rows height (provides adequate vertical space for table content plus status bar in LayoutSmall mode)
- Terminal size detection is available through the application framework
- The warning overlay takes precedence over all other UI elements including modals (modal state is preserved underneath but warning displays on top)
- Users have the ability to resize their terminal window (not in embedded/restricted environments)
- The application layout adapts to terminal size changes through existing responsive layout mechanisms

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Warning appears within 100 milliseconds of terminal being resized below minimum dimensions
- **SC-002**: Warning automatically dismisses within 100 milliseconds of terminal meeting minimum size requirements
- **SC-003**: 100% of resize events are detected and handled without requiring application restart
- **SC-004**: Application remains responsive during resize events with no lag or freeze in warning display/dismissal
- **SC-005**: Users can understand the problem and solution from the warning message alone without consulting documentation (validated through user testing or heuristic evaluation)
