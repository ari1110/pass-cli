# Specification Quality Checklist: Minimum Terminal Size Enforcement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been verified:

1. **Content Quality**: The spec focuses on what users need (warning display, automatic recovery) and why (prevent confusion, smooth UX), without specifying how to implement it technically.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 10 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003 can be tested by resizing below threshold and verifying overlay appears)
   - Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (100ms response time, 100% detection rate)
   - Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific UI frameworks or rendering methods)
   - Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format for clarity
   - Edge cases cover boundary conditions and state transitions

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
   - Three prioritized user stories (P1: warning display, P2: recovery, P3: visual clarity) cover the complete feature
   - Assumptions section clearly documents decisions made (60x20 minimum, overlay precedence)
   - Scope is bounded to terminal size enforcement only

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all reasonable defaults have been applied based on industry standards for CLI applications
