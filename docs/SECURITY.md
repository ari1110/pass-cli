## Security Overview

Pass-CLI is designed with security as the primary concern. All credentials are encrypted using industry-standard cryptography and stored locally on your machine with no cloud dependencies.

### Key Security Features

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Military-grade authenticated encryption
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: 600,000 iterations with SHA-256 (hardened, January 2025)
- **System Keychain Integration**: Secure master password storage
- **Offline-First Design**: No network calls, no cloud dependencies
- **Secure Memory Handling**: Byte-based password handling with immediate zeroing
- **Password Policy Enforcement**: Complexity requirements for vault and credential passwords
- **Tamper-Evident Audit Logging**: HMAC-SHA256 signed audit trail (optional)
- **File Permission Protection**: Vault files restricted to user-only access
- **Atomic Vault Operations**: Rollback safety for vault updates

## Cryptographic Implementation

### Encryption Algorithm

**AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)**

- **Algorithm**: Advanced Encryption Standard
- **Key Size**: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- **Mode**: GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Authentication**: Built-in GMAC authentication tag
- **Implementation**: Go standard library `crypto/aes` and `crypto/cipher`

#### Why AES-256-GCM?

1. **NIST Approved**: Recommended by NIST for classified information
2. **Authenticated Encryption**: Prevents tampering and chosen-ciphertext attacks
3. **Parallelizable**: Fast performance on modern hardware
4. **Standard**: Widely used and well-audited implementation

### Key Derivation

**PBKDF2-SHA256**

- **Algorithm**: Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2
- **Hash Function**: SHA-256
- **Iterations**: 600,000 (increased from 100,000 in January 2025)
- **Salt Length**: 32 bytes (256 bits)
- **Output Length**: 32 bytes (256 bits)
- **Implementation**: `golang.org/x/crypto/pbkdf2`
- **Performance**: ~50-100ms on modern CPUs (2023+), 500-1000ms on older hardware

#### Key Derivation Process

```
Master Key = PBKDF2(
    password = user's master password,
    salt = unique 32-byte random salt,
    iterations = 600,000,
    hash = SHA-256,
    key_length = 32 bytes
)
```

#### Why PBKDF2?

1. **Computationally Expensive**: 600,000 iterations significantly slow down brute-force attacks
2. **Salted**: Unique salt prevents rainbow table attacks
3. **Standard**: NIST recommended for password-based cryptography
4. **Deterministic**: Same password + salt = same key

#### Migration from 100k to 600k Iterations

- **Backward Compatibility**: Vaults with 100k iterations continue to work
- **Automatic Detection**: Iteration count stored in vault metadata
- **Migration Path**: Use `pass-cli migrate` to upgrade existing vaults
- **See**: `docs/MIGRATION.md` for detailed upgrade instructions

### Encryption Process

#### Encrypting Credentials

1. **Generate Salt** (first time only)
   ```
   salt = crypto/rand.Read(32 bytes)
   ```

2. **Derive Encryption Key**
   ```
   key = PBKDF2(master_password, salt, 600000, SHA256, 32)
   ```

3. **Generate Nonce**
   ```
   nonce = crypto/rand.Read(12 bytes)  // Per-encryption unique
   ```

4. **Encrypt Data**
   ```
   ciphertext = AES-256-GCM.Encrypt(
       plaintext = JSON(credentials),
       key = derived_key,
       nonce = nonce,
       additional_data = nil
   )
   ```

5. **Combine Components**
   ```
   vault_file = nonce || ciphertext || auth_tag
   ```

#### Decrypting Credentials

1. **Load Master Password** from system keychain
2. **Read Vault File** and extract salt, nonce, ciphertext
3. **Derive Key** using PBKDF2 with stored salt
4. **Decrypt and Verify**
   ```
   plaintext = AES-256-GCM.Decrypt(
       ciphertext,
       key,
       nonce
   )
   ```
5. **Parse JSON** to access credentials

### Random Number Generation

All random values use `crypto/rand`, which provides cryptographically secure random numbers from the operating system:

- **Windows**: `CryptGenRandom`
- **macOS/Linux**: `/dev/urandom`

Used for:
- Salt generation
- Nonce generation
- Password generation

## Master Password Management

### System Keychain Integration

Pass-CLI integrates with your operating system's secure credential storage to save your master password.

#### Windows - Credential Manager

- **Location**: Windows Credential Manager
- **Storage**: Encrypted by Windows using DPAPI
- **Access**: Protected by user's Windows login
- **Implementation**: `github.com/zalando/go-keyring`

**Viewing in Windows:**
1. Open Control Panel
2. User Accounts → Credential Manager
3. Windows Credentials
4. Look for "pass-cli" entry

#### macOS - Keychain

- **Location**: macOS Keychain (login keychain)
- **Storage**: Encrypted by macOS keychain services
- **Access**: Protected by user's macOS login password
- **Implementation**: `github.com/zalando/go-keyring`

**Viewing on macOS:**
1. Open Keychain Access app
2. Search for "pass-cli"
3. Double-click to view (requires password)

#### Linux - Secret Service

- **Backend**: GNOME Keyring, KWallet, or compatible
- **Protocol**: freedesktop.org Secret Service API
- **Storage**: Encrypted by keyring daemon
- **Access**: Protected by keyring password
- **Implementation**: `github.com/zalando/go-keyring`

**Viewing on Linux (GNOME):**
1. Open Seahorse (Passwords and Keys)
2. Login keyring
3. Search for "pass-cli"

### Master Password Requirements

**Since January 2025** - Password policy enforced for both vault and credential passwords:

- **Minimum Length**: 12 characters (enforced)
- **Uppercase Letter**: At least one required
- **Lowercase Letter**: At least one required
- **Digit**: At least one required
- **Special Symbol**: At least one required (!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:,.<>?)
- **Recommended Length**: 20+ characters for master password
- **Strength Indicator**: Real-time feedback in TUI mode

### Master Password Security

**What Pass-CLI Does:**
- ✅ Stores master password in system keychain
- ✅ Clears password from memory after use
- ✅ Never writes password to disk in plaintext
- ✅ Never logs password

**What You Should Do:**
- ✅ Use a unique master password (not reused elsewhere)
- ✅ Make it strong (20+ characters or passphrase)
- ✅ Store backup securely (password manager, safe place)
- ❌ Don't share your master password
- ❌ Don't write it in plaintext files

## Data Storage Security

### Vault File Location

- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.pass-cli\vault.enc`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.pass-cli/vault.enc`

### File Permissions

Vault files are created with restricted permissions:

- **Unix (macOS/Linux)**: `0600` (owner read/write only)
- **Windows**: ACL restricting to current user

### Vault File Structure

```
+------------------+
| Salt (32 bytes)  |  ← PBKDF2 salt
+------------------+
| Nonce (12 bytes) |  ← AES-GCM nonce
+------------------+
| Ciphertext       |  ← Encrypted credentials (variable length)
+------------------+
| Auth Tag         |  ← GCM authentication tag (16 bytes)
+------------------+
```

### Atomic Writes

Vault updates use atomic write operations to prevent corruption:

1. Write to temporary file (`.vault.enc.tmp`)
2. Sync to disk (`fsync`)
3. Rename to actual vault file (atomic operation)
4. Delete temporary file on error

This ensures:
- No partial writes
- No corruption on crash
- Previous vault preserved on error

### Backup Strategy

Before each vault update:
1. Current vault backed up to `.vault.enc.backup`
2. New vault written atomically
3. Backup kept for disaster recovery

### Audit Logging (Optional)

**Since January 2025** - Tamper-evident audit trail for vault operations:

- **Opt-In**: Disabled by default, enable with `--enable-audit` flag
- **HMAC Signatures**: HMAC-SHA256 signatures for tamper detection
- **Key Storage**: Audit HMAC keys stored in OS keychain (separate from vault)
- **Events Logged**: Vault unlock/lock, password changes, credential operations
- **Privacy**: Service names logged, passwords NEVER logged
- **Rotation**: Automatic log rotation at 10MB, 7-day retention
- **Verification**: `pass-cli verify-audit` command to check log integrity
- **Graceful Degradation**: Operations continue even if audit logging fails

**Audit Log Location**:
- **Default**: Same directory as vault (e.g., `~/.pass-cli/audit.log`)
- **Custom**: Set `PASS_AUDIT_LOG` environment variable

**Enable Audit Logging**:
```bash
# New vault with audit logging
pass-cli init --enable-audit

# Verify audit log integrity
pass-cli verify-audit
```

**Audit Log Entry Example**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-13T10:30:45.123Z",
  "event_type": "credential_access",
  "outcome": "success",
  "credential_name": "github.com",
  "hmac_signature": "a1b2c3..."
}
```

## Threat Model

### What Pass-CLI Protects Against

✅ **Offline Attacks**
- Vault file encryption protects against offline brute-force
- PBKDF2 slows down password cracking (600,000 iterations)
- No plaintext credentials stored anywhere

✅ **File System Compromise**
- Encrypted vault remains secure even if file is stolen
- File permissions prevent unauthorized local access

✅ **Process Memory Dumps**
- Sensitive data cleared from memory after use
- Master password not kept in memory permanently

✅ **Accidental Disclosure**
- No cloud storage = no cloud breach risk
- No network calls = no network interception

✅ **Unauthorized Local Access**
- System keychain protects master password
- File permissions restrict vault access

### What Pass-CLI Does NOT Protect Against

❌ **Malware on Your Machine**
- Keyloggers can capture master password when entered
- Memory scrapers can extract decrypted credentials
- Root/admin access bypasses file permissions

❌ **Physical Access Attacks**
- Attacker with physical access can copy vault file
- Vault encryption is only protection (strong password essential)

❌ **Side-Channel Attacks**
- Timing attacks, power analysis not mitigated
- Not designed for hostile multi-user systems

❌ **Weak Master Passwords**
- PBKDF2 slows attacks but doesn't prevent them
- Short/common passwords can be brute-forced

❌ **Social Engineering**
- Cannot protect against phishing for master password
- User education essential

❌ **TUI Display Security (Interactive Mode)**
- Shoulder surfing: Credentials visible on screen in TUI mode
- Screen recording: TUI displays service names and details
- Password visibility toggle: `Ctrl+H` shows plaintext passwords
- Shared terminals: Other users may see credential list

## Security Guarantees

### What We Guarantee

1. **Confidentiality**: Credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM
2. **Integrity**: Authentication tag prevents tampering
3. **Forward Secrecy**: Unique nonce per encryption
4. **Secure Defaults**: No insecure configuration options

### What We Cannot Guarantee

1. **Availability**: Forgot password = lost vault
2. **Recovery**: No backdoor or recovery mechanism
3. **Zero-Knowledge**: Master password accessible via keychain
4. **Perfect Security**: Subject to implementation bugs

## Limitations

### Known Limitations

1. **Master Password Recovery**: None available
   - If you forget master password, vault is unrecoverable
   - No "forgot password" mechanism
   - No backdoor or master key

2. **Keychain Dependency**
   - Master password security depends on OS keychain
   - Compromise of OS account = compromise of master password

3. **Single-User Design**
   - Not designed for multi-user systems
   - File permissions rely on OS access controls

4. **No Network Security**
   - Offline-only design
   - No secure sharing mechanism

5. **Memory Security**
   - Go garbage collector may leave memory traces
   - Sensitive data cleared but not guaranteed wiped

### Out of Scope

- ✗ Cloud synchronization
- ✗ Multi-user support
- ✗ Hardware security module (HSM) integration
- ✗ Biometric authentication
- ✗ Two-factor authentication for master password

## Best Practices

### Password Management

1. **Strong Master Password**
   ```
   ✅ Good: "correct-horse-battery-staple-29!" (33 chars)
   ✅ Good: "MyD0g!sN@med$potAnd1L0veH1m" (29 chars)
   ❌ Bad:  "password123" (11 chars, common)
   ❌ Bad:  "MyPassword1" (11 chars, predictable)
   ```

2. **Password Storage**
   - Write master password in password manager (ironic but practical)
   - Or write on paper, store in safe place
   - Don't store in plaintext file

3. **Password Rotation**
   - Change master password periodically
   - Rotate individual credentials regularly
   - Use `pass-cli generate` for new credentials

### Operational Security

1. **Vault Backups**
   ```bash
   # Regular backups
   cp ~/.pass-cli/vault.enc ~/backups/vault-$(date +%Y%m%d).enc

   # Store backups securely (encrypted drive, safe location)
   ```

2. **Clipboard Security**
   - Clipboard cleared automatically after 30 seconds
   - Avoid pasting into untrusted applications
   - Use `--no-clipboard` if concerned

3. **Script Security**
   ```bash
   # ✅ Good: Use quiet mode to avoid logging
   export API_KEY=$(pass-cli get service --quiet)

   # ❌ Bad: Full output might be logged
   export API_KEY=$(pass-cli get service)
   ```

4. **Audit Usage**
   ```bash
   # Review unused credentials monthly
   pass-cli list --unused --days 90

   # Delete obsolete credentials
   pass-cli delete old-service
   ```

### TUI-Specific Security

1. **Screen Privacy**
   - ⚠️ **Shoulder Surfing Risk**: TUI displays credential list on screen
   - Use privacy screen protector in public spaces
   - Be aware of people nearby when using TUI
   - Consider using CLI mode for sensitive environments

2. **Password Visibility Toggle**
   - `Ctrl+H` in add/edit forms shows passwords in plaintext
   - **Only use in private, trusted environments**
   - Password resets to masked when form closes
   - Be cautious in:
     - Open offices
     - Coffee shops
     - Shared workspaces
     - Screen sharing sessions
     - Video calls with screen share

3. **Screen Recording Protection**
   - TUI displays service names and usernames by default
   - Pause screen recording before launching TUI
   - Use CLI mode with `--quiet` when recording tutorials
   - Consider: `pass-cli list --format simple` for screen shares

4. **Shared Terminal Sessions**
   - **Never use TUI on shared terminal sessions**
   - tmux/screen sessions visible to other users
   - Use CLI mode with `--no-clipboard` instead
   - SSH sessions: ensure you control the connection

5. **Terminal History**
   - TUI mode doesn't log to shell history
   - CLI commands may appear in history
   - Clear history after sensitive operations:
     ```bash
     history -c  # Clear session history
     ```

### System Security

1. **Secure Your OS Account**
   - Use strong OS login password
   - Enable full-disk encryption
   - Keep system updated

2. **File System Security**
   - Don't commit vault to version control
   - Add to `.gitignore`:
     ```
     .pass-cli/
     *.enc
     ```

3. **Access Control**
   - Don't run Pass-CLI as root/admin
   - Use regular user account
   - Verify vault file permissions

### Development Security

1. **Testing**
   ```bash
   # Use separate vault for testing
   pass-cli --vault /tmp/test-vault.enc init

   # Clean up after testing
   rm -f /tmp/test-vault.enc
   ```

2. **Debugging**
   - Use `--verbose` flag, not hardcoded logging
   - Don't log credential values
   - Clear terminal after debugging
