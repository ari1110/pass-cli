## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
None ✅

### High Priority Issues
None ✅

### Medium Priority Issues
None ✅

### Low Priority / Notes

1. **Archives Not Created**
   - Snapshot mode doesn't create .tar.gz/.zip archives
   - This is expected behavior for snapshot builds
   - Production release will create archives automatically
   - **Action**: Verify archives in actual release (Task 16)

2. **Checksums Placeholders**
   - Homebrew formula has placeholder SHA256 values
   - Scoop manifest has placeholder hash values
   - **Action**: Update with actual checksums during release

3. **GoReleaser Git Warnings**
   - Warning about missing remote URL (expected in test environment)
   - Commit/tag info shows "none" (expected in snapshot)
   - **Action**: Actual release will have proper git metadata
