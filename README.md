## üìñ Usage

### Initialize Vault

```bash
# Create a new vault
pass-cli init

# The vault is stored at ~/.pass-cli/
```

### Add Credentials

```bash
# Interactive mode (prompts for username/password)
pass-cli add myservice

# With URL and notes
pass-cli add github --url https://github.com --notes "Personal account"

# Generate a strong password separately, then add credential
pass-cli generate
# Copy generated password, then:
pass-cli add newservice
# (Paste password when prompted)
```

### Retrieve Credentials

```bash
# Display credential (formatted)
pass-cli get myservice

# Copy password to clipboard
pass-cli get myservice --copy

# Quiet mode for scripts (password only)
pass-cli get myservice --quiet

# Get specific field
pass-cli get myservice --field username --quiet

# Display with masked password
pass-cli get myservice --masked
```

### List Credentials

```bash
# List all credentials
pass-cli list

# Show unused credentials
pass-cli list --unused
```

### Update Credentials

```bash
# Update password (prompted)
pass-cli update myservice

# Update specific fields
pass-cli update myservice --username newuser@example.com
pass-cli update myservice --url https://new-url.com
pass-cli update myservice --notes "Updated notes"

```

### Delete Credentials

```bash
# Delete a credential (with confirmation)
pass-cli delete myservice

# Force delete (no confirmation)
pass-cli delete myservice --force
```

### Generate Passwords

```bash
# Generate a password (default: 20 chars, alphanumeric + symbols)
pass-cli generate

# Custom length
pass-cli generate --length 32

# Alphanumeric only (no symbols)
pass-cli generate --no-symbols
```

### Version Information

```bash
# Check version
pass-cli version

# Verbose version info
pass-cli version --verbose
```

## üîê Security

### Encryption

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations (hardened January 2025)
- **Salt**: Unique 32-byte random salt per vault
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication tag (GCM) prevents tampering
- **IV**: Unique initialization vector per credential
- **Performance**: ~50-100ms on modern CPUs, 500-1000ms on older hardware

### Password Policy (January 2025)

All passwords (vault and credentials) must meet:
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one digit
- At least one special symbol (!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:,.<>?)

### Audit Logging (Optional)

Enable tamper-evident audit logging:
```bash
# Initialize vault with audit logging
pass-cli init --enable-audit

# Verify audit log integrity
pass-cli verify-audit
```

Audit logs use HMAC-SHA256 signatures and store keys in OS keychain.

### Master Password Storage

Pass-CLI integrates with your operating system's secure credential storage:

- **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager
- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Linux**: Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet)

Your master password is stored securely and unlocked automatically when needed.

### Clipboard Security

When using `--copy`, the clipboard is:
1. Cleared after 30 seconds automatically
2. Only contains the password (no metadata)
3. Can be cleared immediately with Ctrl+C

### Vault Location

The encrypted vault is stored at:
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.pass-cli\vault.enc`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.pass-cli/vault.enc`

### Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Use a strong, unique master password (20+ characters, meets complexity requirements)
- ‚úÖ Keep your vault backed up (it's just a file!)
- ‚úÖ Use `--generate` for new passwords (automatic policy compliance)
- ‚úÖ Regularly update credentials
- ‚úÖ Use `--quiet` mode in scripts to avoid logging sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Enable audit logging for compliance/security monitoring (`--enable-audit`)
- ‚úÖ Migrate old vaults to 600k iterations (see `docs/MIGRATION.md`)
- ‚ùå Don't commit vault files to version control
- ‚ùå Don't share your master password

## ü§ñ Script Integration

### Shell Integration Examples

**Bash/Zsh**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Export API key for use in script
export API_KEY=$(pass-cli get openai --quiet --field password)

# Use in curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(pass-cli get github --quiet)" \
     https://api.github.com/user

# Conditional on success
if pass-cli get myservice --quiet > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Credential exists"
fi
```

**PowerShell**:

```powershell
# Store credential in variable
$apiKey = pass-cli get myservice --quiet --field password

# Use in web request
$headers = @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $apiKey"
}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.example.com" -Headers $headers

# Use with environment variable
$env:DATABASE_PASSWORD = pass-cli get postgres --quiet
```

**CI/CD Integration**:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
steps:
  - name: Retrieve credentials
    run: |
      export DB_PASSWORD=$(pass-cli get database --quiet)
      ./deploy.sh
```

### Output Modes

| Flag | Output | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| (default) | Formatted table | Human-readable display |
| `--quiet` | Password only | Scripts, export to variables |
| `--field <name>` | Specific field | Extract username, URL, etc. |
| `--masked` | Masked password | Display password as asterisks |

## üìä Usage Tracking

Pass-CLI automatically tracks where credentials are accessed based on your current working directory:

```bash
# Access from different directories
cd ~/project-a
pass-cli get database

cd ~/project-b
pass-cli get database

# View usage information with list command
pass-cli list --unused --days 30
```

This helps you:
- Identify which projects use which credentials
- Track credential usage patterns
- Audit credential access
- Find unused credentials for cleanup

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Custom Vault Location

```bash
# Use a custom vault location
pass-cli --vault /path/to/custom/vault.enc list

# Or set via environment variable
export PASS_CLI_VAULT=/path/to/custom/vault.enc
pass-cli list
```

### Verbose Logging

```bash
# Enable verbose output for debugging
pass-cli --verbose get myservice
```

### Configuration File

Pass-CLI supports user configuration via `config.yaml` (added in January 2025). This allows you to customize keybindings, terminal thresholds, and default settings.

**Configuration Location**:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/pass-cli/config.yml`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\pass-cli\config.yml`

**Create and Edit Configuration**:

```bash
# Initialize default config
pass-cli config init

# Edit config in default editor
pass-cli config edit

# Validate config syntax
pass-cli config validate

# Reset to defaults
pass-cli config reset
```

**Example Configuration**:

```yaml
# ~/.config/pass-cli/config.yml

# Terminal display thresholds
terminal:
  min_width: 60   # Minimum columns (default: 60)
  min_height: 30  # Minimum rows (default: 30)

# Custom keyboard shortcuts (TUI mode)
keybindings:
  quit: "q"                  # Quit application
  add_credential: "n"        # Add new credential
  edit_credential: "e"       # Edit credential
  delete_credential: "d"     # Delete credential
  help: "?"                  # Show help modal
  search: "/"                # Activate search

# Supported key formats:
# - Single letters: a-z
# - Numbers: 0-9
# - Function keys: f1-f12
# - Modifiers: ctrl+, alt+, shift+
# Examples: ctrl+q, alt+a, shift+f1

# Validation: Config is validated on load
# - Duplicate keys rejected (conflict detection)
# - Unknown actions rejected
# - Invalid config shows warning modal, app continues with defaults
```

**Keybinding Customization**:
- Some TUI shortcuts can be customized via config.yaml
- Navigation shortcuts (Tab, arrows, Enter, Esc) are hardcoded and cannot be changed
- UI hints automatically update to reflect your custom keybindings in status bar and help modal

For complete configuration reference, see [docs/USAGE.md#configuration](docs/USAGE.md#configuration).

## ‚ùì FAQ

### How is this different from `pass` (the standard Unix password manager)?

Pass-CLI offers:
- System keychain integration (no GPG required)
- Built-in clipboard support
- Usage tracking
- Cross-platform Windows support
- Script-friendly output modes (--quiet, --field, --masked)
- Single binary distribution

### Is my data stored in the cloud?

No. Pass-CLI stores everything locally on your machine. There are no cloud dependencies or network calls.

### Can I sync my vault across machines?

The vault is a single encrypted file (`~/.pass-cli/vault.enc`). You can sync it using any file sync service (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.), but be aware of potential conflicts if editing from multiple machines simultaneously.

### What happens if I forget my master password?

Unfortunately, there's no way to recover your vault without the master password. The encryption is designed to be unbreakable. Keep your master password safe and consider backing it up securely.

### How do I backup my vault?

Simply copy the vault file:
```bash
cp ~/.pass-cli/vault.enc ~/backup/vault-$(date +%Y%m%d).enc
```

### Can I use Pass-CLI in my company?

Yes! Pass-CLI is MIT licensed and free for commercial use. It's designed for professional developer workflows.
