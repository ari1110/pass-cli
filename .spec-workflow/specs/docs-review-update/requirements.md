# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Pass-CLI has reached its first release (v0.0.1) with comprehensive documentation created during the initial release phase. Now that the project is live and workflows are updated (GitHub Actions dependencies), we need to systematically review and update all documentation to ensure accuracy, consistency, and alignment with the current state of the project. This spec focuses on auditing existing documentation, identifying gaps and outdated content, and bringing all docs into sync with the actual implementation.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the Product Principles from product.md:
- **Developer Experience**: Accurate documentation is essential for speed and simplicity
- **Open Source**: Transparent, up-to-date documentation builds trust and enables community contributions
- **Quality**: Ensuring documentation matches reality maintains the 90%+ quality standard

It directly addresses the Success Metrics:
- **Distribution**: Correct installation instructions for Homebrew and Scoop are critical for package repository acceptance
- **Usability**: Accurate documentation ensures developers can quickly understand and use Pass-CLI
- **Adoption**: High-quality docs drive GitHub stars and community engagement

## Requirements

### FR-1: Documentation Inventory and Assessment

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a complete inventory of all documentation files with their current status, so that I can understand what exists and what needs attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation review begins THEN the system SHALL identify all markdown documentation files in the repository (excluding .spec-workflow and node_modules)
2. WHEN analyzing each document THEN the system SHALL categorize it by type (user-facing, developer-facing, operational, or obsolete)
3. WHEN assessing relevance THEN the system SHALL determine if each document is still needed for the v0.0.1 release
4. WHEN evaluating accuracy THEN the system SHALL identify documents that are in-sync vs out-of-sync with current implementation
5. WHEN creating the inventory THEN the system SHALL document the following for each file:
   - File path and purpose
   - Category (user/developer/operational/obsolete)
   - Relevance status (needed/deprecated/unclear)
   - Sync status (in-sync/out-of-sync/needs-verification)
   - Priority for update (critical/high/medium/low)
   - Specific issues found (if any)

### FR-2: Critical Documentation Verification

**User Story:** As a new user, I want accurate installation and usage instructions, so that I can successfully install and use Pass-CLI without errors.

   - Installation instructions match actual available installation methods for v0.0.1
   - GitHub repository URLs are correct (currently showing placeholders like "yourusername")
   - Version numbers reference v0.0.1
   - Feature list matches implemented capabilities per product.md (including --quiet, --field, --masked, --no-clipboard flags; excluding --json which is future)
   - Quick start examples work with current CLI syntax
2. WHEN verifying INSTALLATION.md THEN the system SHALL confirm:
   - Homebrew tap URLs point to actual repositories
   - Scoop bucket URLs point to actual repositories
   - Manual installation steps match actual release artifacts from v0.0.1
   - Platform-specific instructions are accurate
3. WHEN verifying USAGE.md THEN the system SHALL validate:
   - All command examples use correct syntax
   - All flags and options match current implementation (--quiet, --field, --masked, --no-clipboard confirmed; --json is NOT implemented yet)
   - Script integration examples work with v0.0.1 (using --quiet and --field only, not --json)
   - Usage tracking behavior is correctly described (automatic based on $PWD, no manual flags required)
4. WHEN verifying SECURITY.md THEN the system SHALL check:
   - Encryption algorithms match actual implementation (AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 at 100k iterations per tech.md)
   - Keychain integration details are accurate per platform (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
   - Threat model reflects current architecture
   - File permission strategy documented correctly (600 on Unix, Windows ACLs on Windows, encryption as primary defense)

### FR-3: Developer Documentation Alignment

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want development and release documentation that matches the current build and CI/CD setup, so that I can successfully contribute and maintain the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verifying DEVELOPMENT.md THEN the system SHALL ensure:
   - Go version requirements match go.mod and tech.md (Go 1.25+)
   - Build commands are correct for current Makefile
   - Test commands work with current test setup
   - Development dependencies are listed accurately per tech.md (Cobra v1.10.1, Viper v1.21.0, go-keyring v0.2.6, etc.)
2. WHEN verifying CI-CD.md THEN the system SHALL check:
   - Workflow descriptions match actual .github/workflows/*.yml files
   - GitHub Actions versions are current (post-dependency updates)
   - Required secrets are documented correctly
   - Badge URLs and status indicators are functional
3. WHEN verifying RELEASE.md THEN the system SHALL validate:
   - Release process matches current GoReleaser configuration
   - Version tagging conventions are correct (currently v0.0.1)
   - Distribution methods reflect available channels
   - PAT setup instructions are accurate

### FR-4: Operational Documentation Currency

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want operational docs like troubleshooting and platform-specific guides to reflect the current release state, so that users can resolve issues independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verifying TROUBLESHOOTING.md THEN the system SHALL check:
   - Common issues list reflects v0.0.1 known issues
   - Platform-specific problems are accurate
   - Solutions work with current implementation
   - Contact/support information is current
2. WHEN verifying HOMEBREW.md and SCOOP.md THEN the system SHALL ensure:
   - Formula/manifest locations are correct
   - Auto-update configuration matches GoReleaser setup
   - Submission instructions reflect actual package manager requirements
3. WHEN verifying platform-specific docs (manifests/*/README.md) THEN the system SHALL confirm:
   - Snap and winget instructions are accurate or marked as future work
   - Configuration examples match current release artifacts

### FR-5: Documentation Consistency and Cross-References

**User Story:** As a documentation reader, I want consistent information across all docs with working cross-references, so that I don't encounter conflicting or broken information.

   - Product naming is consistent (Pass-CLI vs pass-cli vs passcli)

### FR-6: Obsolete Documentation Identification

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to identify and remove obsolete documentation, so that users aren't confused by outdated information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying obsolete docs THEN the system SHALL flag files that:
   - Reference removed features or deprecated workflows
   - Duplicate information better covered elsewhere
   - Are no longer relevant post-v0.0.1 release
2. WHEN recommending removal THEN the system SHALL provide:
   - Clear justification for why the doc is obsolete
   - Migration path if content should be consolidated elsewhere
   - Archive recommendation if doc has historical value

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Documentation Organization**: Docs should be logically organized (user docs in root, developer docs clearly marked)
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information should have one authoritative location
- **Clear Hierarchy**: README â†’ specific docs pattern for progressive disclosure

### NFR-2: Accuracy and Quality
- **Zero Broken Links**: All internal and external links must be functional
- **Executable Examples**: All code/command examples must be tested and working
