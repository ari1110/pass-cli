# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Pass-CLI is a secure, cross-platform command-line password and API key manager designed for developers. It provides local encrypted storage with optional system keychain integration, allowing developers to securely manage credentials without relying on cloud services. The tool prioritizes security, simplicity, and developer workflow integration.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This tool addresses the critical need for developers to securely manage API keys, passwords, and other sensitive credentials in their local development environment. It fills the gap between simple plaintext storage (insecure) and full-featured password managers (overkill for development use cases).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Vault Initialization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize a secure vault with a master password, so that I can begin storing credentials safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `pass init` THEN system SHALL prompt for master password
2. WHEN master password is provided THEN system SHALL create encrypted vault file at `~/.pass-cli/vault.enc`
3. WHEN system keychain is available THEN system SHALL offer to store master password in keychain
4. IF vault already exists THEN system SHALL warn user and require confirmation to overwrite
5. WHEN initialization completes THEN system SHALL display success message with vault location

### Requirement 2: Credential Storage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add API keys and passwords to my vault, so that I can retrieve them later securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `pass add <service>` THEN system SHALL prompt for username and password/API key
2. WHEN credentials are provided THEN system SHALL encrypt and store them with service name as key
3. WHEN service already exists THEN system SHALL warn and require confirmation to overwrite
4. IF vault is locked THEN system SHALL prompt for master password first
5. WHEN storage completes THEN system SHALL confirm successful addition

### Requirement 3: Credential Retrieval

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to retrieve stored credentials quickly, so that I can use them in my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `pass get <service>` THEN system SHALL decrypt and display the credential
2. WHEN credential is displayed THEN system SHALL automatically copy it to clipboard
3. IF service does not exist THEN system SHALL display error message with suggestions
4. WHEN clipboard copy succeeds THEN system SHALL display confirmation message
5. IF vault is locked THEN system SHALL prompt for master password first

### Requirement 4: Credential Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to list, update, and delete stored credentials, so that I can maintain my credential vault.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `pass list` THEN system SHALL display all service names with creation dates
2. WHEN user runs `pass update <service>` THEN system SHALL allow editing existing credentials
3. WHEN user runs `pass delete <service>` THEN system SHALL remove credential after confirmation
4. IF service does not exist for update/delete THEN system SHALL display appropriate error
5. WHEN operations complete THEN system SHALL display confirmation messages

### Requirement 5: Password Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate secure passwords, so that I can create strong credentials for new services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user runs `pass generate` THEN system SHALL create cryptographically secure password
2. WHEN password is generated THEN system SHALL copy it to clipboard automatically
3. WHEN user provides length parameter THEN system SHALL respect the specified length (12-64 chars)
4. WHEN user provides character set options THEN system SHALL include/exclude specified characters
5. WHEN generation completes THEN system SHALL display password and confirmation of clipboard copy

### Requirement 6: Cross-Platform Keychain Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my master password stored in my system's keychain, so that I don't have to enter it repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system keychain is available THEN system SHALL offer integration during init
2. WHEN keychain integration is enabled THEN system SHALL store master password securely
3. WHEN vault is accessed THEN system SHALL attempt keychain retrieval before prompting
4. IF keychain access fails THEN system SHALL fall back to password prompt
5. WHEN keychain is unavailable THEN system SHALL work without it (no degraded functionality)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each Go package should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Modular Design**: Crypto, storage, keychain, and CLI components should be isolated and testable
- **Dependency Management**: Use Go modules with minimal external dependencies
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between crypto, storage, and CLI layers

### Performance
- Vault operations must complete within 500ms on standard hardware
- Memory usage should not exceed 50MB during normal operations
- Startup time must be under 100ms for cached operations

### Security
- Use AES-256-GCM encryption for all stored data
- Implement PBKDF2 key derivation with minimum 100,000 iterations
- Never store master password in plaintext
- Use cryptographically secure random number generation
- Clear sensitive data from memory after use

### Reliability
- Vault file corruption must be detectable and recoverable
- Failed operations must not leave vault in inconsistent state
- Graceful handling of locked/unavailable keychain services
- Comprehensive error messages for troubleshooting

### Usability
- Commands must follow standard UNIX conventions
- Help text must be comprehensive and include examples
- Error messages must be actionable and specific
- Clipboard integration must work across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Installation via standard package managers (Homebrew, Scoop)
