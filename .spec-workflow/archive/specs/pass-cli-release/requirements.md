# Requirements Document

## Feature Overview
This specification covers the production release preparation for Pass-CLI v1.0, including comprehensive testing, build automation, package distribution, and documentation. The goal is to transform the MVP implementation into a production-ready, professionally distributed CLI tool available via package managers.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
**User Story**: As a security-conscious developer, I want comprehensive automated tests so that I can trust the security and reliability of the password manager.

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:
- **WHEN** the test suite is run, **THEN** all cryptographic operations **SHALL** be validated against known NIST test vectors
- **WHEN** the test suite is run, **THEN** the system **SHALL** achieve at least 90% code coverage across all internal packages
- **WHEN** integration tests are executed, **THEN** all end-to-end workflows (init → add → get → update → delete) **SHALL** pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **WHERE** tests involve file operations, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** use temporary directories and clean up after completion
- **WHERE** tests involve keychain operations, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** gracefully handle unavailable keychains and test fallback mechanisms

### FR-2: Cross-Platform Build Automation
**User Story**: As a release engineer, I want automated cross-platform builds so that I can reliably produce binaries for all supported platforms.

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:
- **WHEN** a release is triggered, **THEN** the system **SHALL** produce binaries for Windows (amd64, arm64), macOS (amd64, arm64), and Linux (amd64, arm64)
- **WHEN** binaries are built, **THEN** they **SHALL** be statically linked with no runtime dependencies
- **WHERE** GoReleaser is configured, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically generate checksums and release notes
- **WHEN** a build completes, **THEN** all binaries **SHALL** be under 20MB in size
- **WHERE** GitHub Actions is used, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automate the entire release process on git tags

### FR-3: Package Manager Distribution
**User Story**: As a developer user, I want to install Pass-CLI via Homebrew or Scoop so that I can easily manage updates and dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:
- **WHEN** a user runs `brew install pass-cli`, **THEN** the tool **SHALL** install successfully on macOS and Linux
- **WHEN** a user runs `scoop install pass-cli`, **THEN** the tool **SHALL** install successfully on Windows
- **WHERE** package managers are configured, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically detect and install new versions
- **WHEN** installation completes, **THEN** the `pass-cli` command **SHALL** be available in the user's PATH
- **WHERE** package metadata is defined, **IT SHALL** include accurate descriptions, homepage URLs, and license information

### FR-4: Comprehensive Documentation
**User Story**: As a new user, I want clear documentation so that I can quickly understand how to install, use, and secure my credentials.

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:
- **WHEN** a user visits the repository, **THEN** the README **SHALL** include installation instructions, quick start examples, and feature highlights
- **WHERE** security features are documented, **THE DOCUMENTATION SHALL** explain encryption methods, keychain integration, and threat model
- **WHEN** users need command reference, **THEN** documentation **SHALL** include examples for all commands with common use cases
- **WHERE** script integration is documented, **THE DOCUMENTATION SHALL** show real-world examples with environment variables and CI/CD usage
- **WHEN** troubleshooting is needed, **THEN** documentation **SHALL** include common issues and solutions for each platform

### FR-5: Performance Validation
**User Story**: As a developer integrating Pass-CLI into scripts, I want fast response times so that credential retrieval doesn't slow down my workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:
- **WHEN** credentials are retrieved from cache, **THEN** the operation **SHALL** complete in under 100ms
- **WHEN** the vault is unlocked, **THEN** the operation **SHALL** complete in under 500ms
- **WHERE** stress testing is performed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** handle vaults with 1000+ credentials without performance degradation
- **WHEN** memory usage is measured, **THEN** the application **SHALL** use less than 50MB during normal operations
- **WHERE** binary size is measured, **IT SHALL** be under 20MB for all platforms

### FR-6: Security Validation and Audit
**User Story**: As a security-conscious user, I want validated cryptographic security so that I can trust the tool with sensitive credentials.

**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:
- **WHEN** security tests are run, **THEN** all cryptographic operations **SHALL** pass timing attack resistance tests
- **WHERE** sensitive data is in memory, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** clear it after use
- **WHEN** file permissions are set, **THEN** vault files **SHALL** have 0600 permissions on Unix systems
- **WHERE** error messages are generated, **THEY SHALL NOT** expose sensitive information or cryptographic details
- **WHEN** dependencies are audited, **THEN** all third-party libraries **SHALL** be reviewed for known vulnerabilities

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Code Quality
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage across all packages
- Pass all golangci-lint checks with zero issues
- Follow Go best practices and idioms throughout codebase
- Include comprehensive error handling and logging

### NFR-2: Distribution Quality
- All binaries must be reproducible builds
- Package manager installations must be tested on clean systems
- Installation process must complete in under 30 seconds
- All platforms must receive simultaneous releases

### NFR-3: Documentation Quality
- All code examples must be tested and working
- Documentation must be accessible to developers of all experience levels
- Security implications must be clearly explained
- Troubleshooting guides must cover 90% of common issues

### NFR-4: Maintenance
- Build and release process must be fully automated
- CI/CD pipeline must catch failures before release
- Version numbers must follow semantic versioning
- Release notes must be automatically generated from commits

## Success Metrics
- Zero known security vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementation
- All automated tests passing on all platforms
- Successfully published to Homebrew and Scoop repositories
- Documentation covers all features with working examples
- Binary size under 20MB for all platforms
- Response time under 100ms for cached operations

## Out of Scope
