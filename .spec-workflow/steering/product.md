# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
Pass-CLI is a secure, cross-platform command-line password and API key manager designed specifically for developers. It solves the critical problem of securely storing, managing, and accessing credentials in local development environments without relying on cloud services or exposing sensitive data in configuration files.

## Target Users
**Primary Users**: Software developers, DevOps engineers, and security-conscious technologists who:
- Need to manage multiple API keys, database passwords, and service credentials
- Work in local development environments with sensitive credentials
- Prefer command-line tools for workflow integration
- Value security, privacy, and offline-first solutions
- Want lightweight alternatives to full-featured password managers

**Pain Points Addressed**:
- Storing credentials in plaintext configuration files
- Sharing API keys through insecure channels
- Managing credentials across multiple projects and environments
- Remembering complex passwords and rotating API keys
- Lack of CLI-native credential management tools

## Key Features

1. **Local Encrypted Storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation for maximum security
2. **System Keychain Integration**: Optional master password storage in Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service
3. **CLI-First Design**: Fast, intuitive commands optimized for developer workflows
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Single binary distribution for Windows, macOS, and Linux
5. **Offline Operation**: No cloud dependencies, works completely offline
6. **Password Generation**: Cryptographically secure password generation with customizable options
7. **Clipboard Integration**: Automatic credential copying with security timeouts
8. **Package Manager Distribution**: Easy installation via Homebrew and Scoop

## Business Objectives

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce friction in credential management workflows
- **Security Enhancement**: Eliminate plaintext credential storage in development environments
- **Community Impact**: Provide open-source alternative to proprietary credential managers
- **Learning Platform**: Demonstrate Go security best practices and CLI design patterns

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 1,000+ GitHub stars within 6 months
- **Distribution**: Available in Homebrew and Scoop package repositories
- **Security**: Zero known vulnerabilities in encryption implementation
- **Usability**: <100ms response time for all credential operations
- **Quality**: 90%+ test coverage with comprehensive security testing

## Product Principles

1. **Security First**: Never compromise on cryptographic security or data protection
2. **Developer Experience**: Design for speed, simplicity, and CLI integration
3. **Privacy by Design**: Local-only storage with no telemetry or data collection
4. **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable code with community contributions
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Lean binary with essential functionality only

## Monitoring & Visibility (if applicable)

- **Dashboard Type**: Command-line interface with structured output
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback on all operations
- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Credential count, vault status, last updated timestamps
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Export functionality for backup and migration

## Future Vision

Pass-CLI aims to become the standard CLI credential manager for developers, setting the benchmark for security, usability, and integration capabilities in the developer tools ecosystem.

### Potential Enhancements
- **Remote Access**: Secure vault synchronization across multiple development machines
- **Analytics**: Usage patterns and security metrics for credential rotation recommendations
- **Collaboration**: Team-based credential sharing with granular access controls
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Integration with popular development tools and CI/CD platforms
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access logs for security compliance
