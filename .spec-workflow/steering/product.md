# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
Pass-CLI is a secure, cross-platform command-line password and API key manager designed specifically for developers. It solves the critical problem of securely storing, managing, and accessing credentials in local development environments without relying on cloud services or exposing sensitive data in configuration files.

## Target Users
**Primary Users**: Software developers, DevOps engineers, and security-conscious technologists who:
- Need to manage multiple API keys, database passwords, and service credentials
- Work in local development environments with sensitive credentials
- Prefer command-line tools for workflow integration
- Value security, privacy, and offline-first solutions
- Want lightweight alternatives to full-featured password managers

**Pain Points Addressed**:
- Storing credentials in plaintext configuration files
- Sharing API keys through insecure channels
- Managing credentials across multiple projects and environments
- Remembering complex passwords and rotating API keys
- Lack of CLI-native credential management tools

## Key Features

1. **Local Encrypted Storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations) for maximum security
2. **System Keychain Integration**: Automatic master password storage in Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service (unique differentiator for CLI password managers)
3. **Fast CLI Commands**: Script-friendly commands for automation and workflow integration with sub-100ms credential retrieval
4. **Script-Friendly Output**: Support for shell integration with `--quiet`, `--field`, and `--masked` flags for use in scripts like `$env:API_KEY=$(pass-cli get service -q)`
5. **Automatic Usage Tracking**: Intelligent tracking of where credentials are used based on working directory, with no manual flags required
6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Single binary distribution for Windows, macOS (Intel/ARM), and Linux (amd64/arm64)
7. **Offline Operation**: No cloud dependencies, works completely offline
8. **Password Generation**: Cryptographically secure password generation with customizable length and character options
9. **Clipboard Integration**: Automatic credential copying with 30-second timeout and optional `--no-clipboard` flag to disable
10. **Masked Password Display**: Optional `--masked` flag to display passwords as asterisks for additional security
11. **Package Manager Ready**: Homebrew and Scoop manifests prepared for distribution (pending publication to official repositories)

## Business Objectives

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce friction in credential management workflows
- **Security Enhancement**: Eliminate plaintext credential storage in development environments
- **Community Impact**: Provide open-source alternative to proprietary credential managers
- **Learning Platform**: Demonstrate Go security best practices and CLI design patterns

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Target 1,000+ GitHub stars within 6 months (currently in development)
- **Distribution**: Homebrew and Scoop manifests ready for submission to official repositories
- **Security**: Zero known vulnerabilities in encryption implementation (AES-256-GCM with authentication)
- **Usability**: Sub-100ms response time for credential operations (verified in testing)
- **Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage with automated CI/CD testing

## Product Principles

1. **Security First**: Never compromise on cryptographic security or data protection
2. **Developer Experience**: Design for speed, simplicity, and CLI integration
3. **Privacy by Design**: Local-only storage with no telemetry or data collection
4. **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable code with community contributions
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Lean binary with essential functionality only

## Monitoring & Visibility

- **CLI Output Modes**:
  - **Normal Mode**: Formatted table display with credential details
  - **Quiet Mode**: Password-only output for scripting (`--quiet`)
  - **Field Mode**: Extract specific fields like username, URL (`--field`)
  - **Masked Mode**: Display passwords as asterisks (`--masked`)
- **Usage Tracking**:
  - Automatic tracking of credential access by working directory
  - Last used timestamps for all credentials
  - Usage count statistics
  - Unused credential detection (`--unused --days N`)
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Total credential count
  - Credentials per category (in vault data structure)
  - Last accessed timestamps
  - Creation and modification dates

## Competitive Landscape

### Existing Solutions Analysis

**gopass**
- Free, open source, uses GPG + Git
- No OS keychain integration
- Asymmetric encryption (GPG hybrid approach)
- Strong sync capabilities via Git

**Bitwarden CLI**
- Free tier + premium, requires server (cloud or self-hosted)
- No native CLI keychain integration
- Excellent web/mobile integration
- Team collaboration features

**KeePassXC**
- Free, single .kdbx file
- GUI can use keychain but CLI cannot
- Strong security track record
- Cross-platform compatibility

**1Password CLI**
- Paid only, has keychain integration
- Requires desktop app for full functionality
- Excellent UX and team features
- Enterprise-grade security

**Chezmoi**
- Dotfiles manager with keychain integration
- Not a pure password manager
- Uses go-keyring library

**Pass-CLI Positioning**: A pure CLI password manager with native OS keychain integration, symmetric encryption (AES-256-GCM), and automatic usage tracking. Unique features include sub-100ms credential retrieval, automatic directory-based usage tracking without manual flags, and multiple output modes (quiet, field-specific, masked) optimized for shell scripting and CI/CD pipelines.

## Future Vision

Pass-CLI aims to become the standard CLI credential manager for developers, setting the benchmark for security, usability, and integration capabilities in the developer tools ecosystem.

### Features in Development
- **Interactive TUI Dashboard** (In Progress): Multi-panel terminal interface with sidebar navigation, metadata panel, and visual credential management. Core components implemented in `cmd/tui/` using tview framework, pending command registration and final integration.

### Planned Enhancements
- **JSON Output Format**: Add `--json` flag for structured output to enable parsing with jq and other tools
- **Export/Import**: Credential backup and migration functionality for vault portability
- **Browser Extensions**: Integration with web browsers for auto-fill capabilities
- **Remote Sync**: Secure vault synchronization across multiple development machines
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared credential vaults with granular access controls
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP support for credentials requiring 2FA
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access logs for security compliance
- **Advanced Shell Completion**: Enhanced completion for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell
