# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
Pass-CLI is a secure, cross-platform command-line password and API key manager designed specifically for developers. It solves the critical problem of securely storing, managing, and accessing credentials in local development environments without relying on cloud services or exposing sensitive data in configuration files.

## Target Users
**Primary Users**: Software developers, DevOps engineers, and security-conscious technologists who:
- Need to manage multiple API keys, database passwords, and service credentials
- Work in local development environments with sensitive credentials
- Prefer command-line tools for workflow integration
- Value security, privacy, and offline-first solutions
- Want lightweight alternatives to full-featured password managers

**Pain Points Addressed**:
- Storing credentials in plaintext configuration files
- Sharing API keys through insecure channels
- Managing credentials across multiple projects and environments
- Remembering complex passwords and rotating API keys
- Lack of CLI-native credential management tools

## Key Features

1. **Local Encrypted Storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation for maximum security
2. **System Keychain Integration**: Optional master password storage in Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service (unique differentiator for CLI password managers)
3. **Dual Interface Design**:
   - **CLI Commands**: Fast, script-friendly commands for automation and workflow integration
   - **Interactive TUI Dashboard**: Full-featured terminal UI with multi-panel layout, category tree navigation, real-time search, and visual credential management
4. **Script-Friendly Output**: Support for shell integration with `--quiet` and `--field` flags for use in scripts like `$env:API_KEY=$(pass-cli get service -q)`
5. **Automatic Usage Tracking**: Intelligent tracking of where credentials are used based on working directory, with no manual flags required
6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Single binary distribution for Windows, macOS, and Linux
7. **Offline Operation**: No cloud dependencies, works completely offline
8. **Password Generation**: Cryptographically secure password generation with customizable options
9. **Clipboard Integration**: Automatic credential copying with optional `--no-clipboard` flag to disable
10. **Masked Password Display**: Optional `--masked` flag to display passwords as asterisks for additional security
11. **Category-Based Organization**: Hierarchical category system with visual tree navigation in TUI mode
12. **Package Manager Distribution**: Easy installation via Homebrew and Scoop

## Business Objectives

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce friction in credential management workflows
- **Security Enhancement**: Eliminate plaintext credential storage in development environments
- **Community Impact**: Provide open-source alternative to proprietary credential managers
- **Learning Platform**: Demonstrate Go security best practices and CLI design patterns

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 1,000+ GitHub stars within 6 months
- **Distribution**: Available in Homebrew and Scoop package repositories
- **Security**: Zero known vulnerabilities in encryption implementation
- **Usability**: <100ms response time for all credential operations
- **Quality**: 90%+ test coverage with comprehensive security testing

## Product Principles

1. **Security First**: Never compromise on cryptographic security or data protection
2. **Developer Experience**: Design for speed, simplicity, and CLI integration
3. **Privacy by Design**: Local-only storage with no telemetry or data collection
4. **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable code with community contributions
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Lean binary with essential functionality only

## Monitoring & Visibility

- **Interface Types**:
  - **CLI Mode**: Structured command output for scripting and automation
  - **TUI Dashboard**: Interactive multi-panel interface with real-time updates
- **Dashboard Features**:
  - **Multi-Panel Layout**: Sidebar (category tree), main content (list/detail), metadata panel (credential info), status bar (shortcuts and context)
  - **Real-time Search**: Instant credential filtering with live results
  - **Visual Categorization**: Tree-based category navigation with expand/collapse
  - **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout based on terminal size (breakpoints at 80, 120 columns)
  - **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard control with context-aware shortcuts
- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Credential count, vault statistics, usage tracking, last updated timestamps
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Export functionality for backup and migration

## Competitive Landscape

### Existing Solutions Analysis

**gopass**
- Free, open source, uses GPG + Git
- No OS keychain integration
- Asymmetric encryption (GPG hybrid approach)
- Strong sync capabilities via Git

**Bitwarden CLI**
- Free tier + premium, requires server (cloud or self-hosted)
- No native CLI keychain integration
- Excellent web/mobile integration
- Team collaboration features

**KeePassXC**
- Free, single .kdbx file
- GUI can use keychain but CLI cannot
- Strong security track record
- Cross-platform compatibility

**1Password CLI**
- Paid only, has keychain integration
- Requires desktop app for full functionality
- Excellent UX and team features
- Enterprise-grade security

**Chezmoi**
- Dotfiles manager with keychain integration
- Not a pure password manager
- Uses go-keyring library

**Pass-CLI Positioning**: The only pure CLI password manager with native OS keychain integration, symmetric encryption (AES-256-GCM), automatic usage tracking, AND a full-featured interactive TUI dashboard for visual credential management - combining the scriptability of CLI tools with the usability of visual interfaces.

## Future Vision

Pass-CLI aims to become the standard CLI credential manager for developers, setting the benchmark for security, usability, and integration capabilities in the developer tools ecosystem.
