It solves the critical problem of securely storing, managing, and accessing credentials in local development environments without relying on cloud services or exposing sensitive data in configuration files.\n\n## Target Users\n**Primary Users**: Software developers, DevOps engineers, and security-conscious technologists who:\n- Need to manage multiple API keys, database passwords, and service credentials\n- Work in local development environments with sensitive credentials\n- Prefer command-line tools for workflow integration\n- Value security, privacy, and offline-first solutions\n- Want lightweight alternatives to full-featured password managers\n\n**Pain Points Addressed**:\n- Storing credentials in plaintext configuration files\n- Sharing API keys through insecure channels\n- Managing credentials across multiple projects and environments\n- Remembering complex passwords and rotating API keys\n- Lack of CLI-native credential management tools\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Local Encrypted Storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation for maximum security\n2. **System Keychain Integration**: Optional master password storage in Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service\n3. **CLI-First Design**: Fast, intuitive commands optimized for developer workflows\n4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Single binary distribution for Windows, macOS, and Linux\n5. **Offline Operation**: No cloud dependencies, works completely offline\n6. **Password Generation**: Cryptographically secure password generation with customizable options\n7. **Clipboard Integration**: Automatic credential copying with security timeouts\n8. **Package Manager Distribution**: Easy installation via Homebrew and Scoop\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce friction in credential management workflows\n- **Security Enhancement**: Eliminate plaintext credential storage in development environments\n- **Community Impact**: Provide open-source alternative to proprietary credential managers\n- **Learning Platform**: Demonstrate Go security best practices and CLI design patterns\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Adoption**: 1,000+ GitHub stars within 6 months\n- **Distribution**: Available in Homebrew and Scoop package repositories\n- **Security**: Zero known vulnerabilities in encryption implementation\n- **Usability**: <100ms response time for all credential operations\n- **Quality**: 90%+ test coverage with comprehensive security testing\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Security First**: Never compromise on cryptographic security or data protection\n2. **Developer Experience**: Design for speed, simplicity, and CLI integration\n3. **Privacy by Design**: Local-only storage with no telemetry or data collection\n4. **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable code with community contributions\n5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Lean binary with essential functionality only\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility (if applicable)\n\n- **Dashboard Type**: Command-line interface with structured output\n- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback on all operations\n- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Credential count, vault status, last updated timestamps\n- **Sharing Capabilities**: Export functionality for backup and migration\n\n## Future Vision\n\nPass-CLI aims to become the standard CLI credential manager for developers, setting the benchmark for security, usability, and integration capabilities in the developer tools ecosystem.\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n- **Remote Access**: Secure vault synchronization across multiple development machines\n- **Analytics**: Usage patterns and security metrics for credential rotation recommendations\n- **Collaboration**: Team-based credential sharing with granular access controls\n- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Integration with popular development tools and CI/CD platforms\n- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access logs for security compliance",
