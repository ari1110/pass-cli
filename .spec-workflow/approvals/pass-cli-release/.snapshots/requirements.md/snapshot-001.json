The goal is to transform the MVP implementation into a production-ready, professionally distributed CLI tool available via package managers.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### FR-1: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure\n**User Story**: As a security-conscious developer, I want comprehensive automated tests so that I can trust the security and reliability of the password manager.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:\n- **WHEN** the test suite is run, **THEN** all cryptographic operations **SHALL** be validated against known NIST test vectors\n- **WHEN** the test suite is run, **THEN** the system **SHALL** achieve at least 90% code coverage across all internal packages\n- **WHEN** integration tests are executed, **THEN** all end-to-end workflows (init → add → get → update → delete) **SHALL** pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux\n- **WHERE** tests involve file operations, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** use temporary directories and clean up after completion\n- **WHERE** tests involve keychain operations, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** gracefully handle unavailable keychains and test fallback mechanisms\n\n### FR-2: Cross-Platform Build Automation\n**User Story**: As a release engineer, I want automated cross-platform builds so that I can reliably produce binaries for all supported platforms.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:\n- **WHEN** a release is triggered, **THEN** the system **SHALL** produce binaries for Windows (amd64, arm64), macOS (amd64, arm64), and Linux (amd64, arm64)\n- **WHEN** binaries are built, **THEN** they **SHALL** be statically linked with no runtime dependencies\n- **WHERE** GoReleaser is configured, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically generate checksums and release notes\n- **WHEN** a build completes, **THEN** all binaries **SHALL** be under 20MB in size\n- **WHERE** GitHub Actions is used, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automate the entire release process on git tags\n\n### FR-3: Package Manager Distribution\n**User Story**: As a developer user, I want to install Pass-CLI via Homebrew or Scoop so that I can easily manage updates and dependencies.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:\n- **WHEN** a user runs `brew install pass-cli`, **THEN** the tool **SHALL** install successfully on macOS and Linux\n- **WHEN** a user runs `scoop install pass-cli`, **THEN** the tool **SHALL** install successfully on Windows\n- **WHERE** package managers are configured, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically detect and install new versions\n- **WHEN** installation completes, **THEN** the `pass-cli` command **SHALL** be available in the user's PATH\n- **WHERE** package metadata is defined, **IT SHALL** include accurate descriptions, homepage URLs, and license information\n\n### FR-4: Comprehensive Documentation\n**User Story**: As a new user, I want clear documentation so that I can quickly understand how to install, use, and secure my credentials.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:\n- **WHEN** a user visits the repository, **THEN** the README **SHALL** include installation instructions, quick start examples, and feature highlights\n- **WHERE** security features are documented, **THE DOCUMENTATION SHALL** explain encryption methods, keychain integration, and threat model\n- **WHEN** users need command reference, **THEN** documentation **SHALL** include examples for all commands with common use cases\n- **WHERE** script integration is documented, **THE DOCUMENTATION SHALL** show real-world examples with environment variables and CI/CD usage\n- **WHEN** troubleshooting is needed, **THEN** documentation **SHALL** include common issues and solutions for each platform\n\n### FR-5: Performance Validation\n**User Story**: As a developer integrating Pass-CLI into scripts, I want fast response times so that credential retrieval doesn't slow down my workflows.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:\n- **WHEN** credentials are retrieved from cache, **THEN** the operation **SHALL** complete in under 100ms\n- **WHEN** the vault is unlocked, **THEN** the operation **SHALL** complete in under 500ms\n- **WHERE** stress testing is performed, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** handle vaults with 1000+ credentials without performance degradation\n- **WHEN** memory usage is measured, **THEN** the application **SHALL** use less than 50MB during normal operations\n- **WHERE** binary size is measured, **IT SHALL** be under 20MB for all platforms\n\n### FR-6: Security Validation and Audit\n**User Story**: As a security-conscious user, I want validated cryptographic security so that I can trust the tool with sensitive credentials.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria (EARS)**:\n- **WHEN** security tests are run, **THEN** all cryptographic operations **SHALL** pass timing attack resistance tests\n- **WHERE** sensitive data is in memory, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** clear it after use\n- **WHEN** file permissions are set, **THEN** vault files **SHALL** have 0600 permissions on Unix systems\n- **WHERE** error messages are generated, **THEY SHALL NOT** expose sensitive information or cryptographic details\n- **WHEN** dependencies are audited, **THEN** all third-party libraries **SHALL** be reviewed for known vulnerabilities\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### NFR-1: Code Quality\n- Maintain 90%+ test coverage across all packages\n- Pass all golangci-lint checks with zero issues\n- Follow Go best practices and idioms throughout codebase\n- Include comprehensive error handling and logging\n\n### NFR-2: Distribution Quality\n- All binaries must be reproducible builds\n- Package manager installations must be tested on clean systems\n- Installation process must complete in under 30 seconds\n- All platforms must receive simultaneous releases\n\n### NFR-3: Documentation Quality\n- All code examples must be tested and working\n- Documentation must be accessible to developers of all experience levels\n- Security implications must be clearly explained\n- Troubleshooting guides must cover 90% of common issues\n\n### NFR-4: Maintenance\n- Build and release process must be fully automated\n- CI/CD pipeline must catch failures before release\n- Version numbers must follow semantic versioning\n- Release notes must be automatically generated from commits\n\n## Success Metrics\n- Zero known security vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementation\n- All automated tests passing on all platforms\n- Successfully published to Homebrew and Scoop repositories\n- Documentation covers all features with working examples\n- Binary size under 20MB for all platforms\n- Response time under 100ms for cached operations\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Mobile application support\n- Cloud synchronization features\n- Team collaboration features\n- Browser extensions\n- GUI application\n- Plugin system\n\n## Dependencies\n- Completed Pass-CLI MVP implementation (Tasks 1-13 from pass-cli spec)\n- GoReleaser installation and configuration\n- GitHub Actions runner access\n- Homebrew tap repository access\n- Scoop bucket repository access\n\n## Assumptions\n- MVP implementation is functional and tested manually\n- All core features work correctly on target platforms\n- Development environment has access to all target platforms for testing\n- Package manager repositories allow third-party submissions\n\n## Constraints\n- Must complete before public announcement\n- Must maintain backward compatibility with MVP vault format\n- Must follow package manager submission guidelines\n- Must not introduce new dependencies that increase binary size significantly",
