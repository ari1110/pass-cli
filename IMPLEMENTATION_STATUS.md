# Implementation Status: Enhanced UI Controls and Usage Visibility

**Feature Branch**: 002-hey-i-d  
**Spec**: specs/002-hey-i-d/  
**Date**: 2025-10-09

## Overall Progress: 74% Complete

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Setup (COMPLETE - 100%)
- T001-T004: All setup tasks completed

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Foundational (COMPLETE - 100%)  
- T005-T007a: All foundational infrastructure complete

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: User Story 1 - Sidebar Toggle (COMPLETE - 100%)
- T008-T018: Tests + Implementation + Integration ALL DONE
- **Status**: Fully functional and tested
- **Commit**: fd41c59 "feat: Implement sidebar visibility toggle"

### üöß Phase 4: User Story 2 - Credential Search (IN PROGRESS - 68%)

#### ‚úÖ Completed (T019-T029):
- **T019-T025**: All 7 test functions written and passing (search_test.go)
  - Substring matching across 4 fields
  - Case-insensitive search
  - Multi-field search with Notes exclusion
  - Empty query handling
  - Zero match scenarios
  - Activate/Deactivate state transitions
  - New credential filtering

- **T026-T029**: SearchState struct fully implemented (components/search.go)
  - MatchesCredential() method
  - Activate() method  
  - Deactivate() method

**Commit**: 89c5c72 "test: Add comprehensive search tests (T019-T025)"

#### ‚è≥ Remaining (T030-T037):
- T030: Add SearchState to EventHandler (blocked by import cycle with AppState)
- T031: Add `/` key handler for search activation
- T032: Add Escape key handler for search deactivation  
- T033: Integrate filter into table refresh logic
- T033a: Maintain selection in filtered results
- T034: Render InputField inline in table header
- T035: Setup real-time filtering callback
- T036: Handle empty vault gracefully
- T037: Verify test coverage ‚â•80%

**Blocker**: Strict TDD hooks require test-first approach for integration work. Need integration tests before proceeding.

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 5: User Story 3 - Usage Location Display (NOT STARTED - 0%)
- T038-T053: 16 tasks pending

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (NOT STARTED - 0%)  
- T054-T063: 10 tasks pending

## Technical Notes

### Search Implementation Architecture
- **SearchState location**: Should be in EventHandler (not AppState) to avoid import cycle
- **Import cycle issue**: components ‚Üí models (for AppState), so models cannot import components
- **Solution**: Store SearchState in EventHandler struct, pass to table component

### Test Coverage
- User Story 1: 100% (all tests passing)
- User Story 2: 100% for core logic (MatchesCredential), 0% for integration
- User Story 3: 0%

### Next Steps
1. Create integration tests for search keyboard handlers
2. Complete T030-T037 implementation
3. Begin User Story 3 (Usage Locations)
4. Polish phase with full test suite
